  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Airplane photography had its birth, and passed through
a period of feverish development, in the Great War. Probably
to many minds it figures as a purely military activity.
Such need not be the case, for the application of aerial
photography to mapping and other peace-time problems
promises soon to quite overshadow its military origin. It
has therefore been the writer's endeavor to treat the subject
as far as possible as a problem of scientific photography,
emphasizing those general principles which will
apply no matter what may be the purpose of making photographs
from the air. It is of course inevitable that whoever
at the present time attempts a treatise on this newest
kind of photography must draw much of his material from
war-time experience. If, for this reason, the problems and
illustrations of this book are predominantly military, it
may be remembered that the demands of war are far more
severe than those of peace; and hence the presumption is
that an account of how photography has been made successful
in the military plane will serve as an excellent guide
to meeting the peace-time problems of the near future.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is assumed that the reader is already fairly conversant
with ordinary photography. Considerable space has indeed
been devoted to a discussion of the fundamentals of photography,
and to scientific methods of study, test, and specification.
This has been done because aerial photography
strains to the utmost the capacity of the photographic
process, and it is necessary that the most advanced methods
be understood by those who would secure the best results
or contribute to future progress. No pretence is made that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>the book is an aerial photographic encyclopædia; it is not a
manual of instructions; nor is its appeal so popular as it
would be were the majority of the illustrations striking
aerial photographs of war subjects. It is hoped that the
middle course steered has produced a volume which will be
informative and inspirational to those who are seriously
interested either in the practice of aerial photography or in
its development.</p>

<p class='c000'>The writer is deeply in debt to many people, whose
assistance of one sort or another has made this book possible.
First of all should be mentioned those officers of the English,
French and Italian armies through whose courtesy it is
that he can speak at first hand of the photographic practices
in these armies at the front. It is due to Lieutenant
Colonel R. A. Millikan that the experimental work of which
the writer has had charge was initiated in the United States
Air Service. To him and to Major C. E. Mendenhall, under
whom the work was organized in the Science and Research
Division of the Signal Corps, are owing the writer's thanks
for the opportunities and support given by them. A similar
acknowledgment is made to Lieutenant Colonel J. S. Sullivan,
Chief of the Photographic Branch of the Army Air Service, for
his interest and encouragement in the compilation of this
work, and for the permission accorded to use the air service
photographs and drawings which form the majority of
the illustrations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest debt of all, however, is to those officers who
have formed the staff of the Experimental Department. To
mention them by name: Captain C. A. Proctor, who was
charged with our foreign liaison, and who acted as deputy
chief during the writer's absence overseas; Captain A. K.
Chapman, in charge of the work on optical parts, and later
chief of our Rochester Branch; Captain E. F. Kingsbury,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>who had immediate charge of camera development; Lieutenant
J. B. Brinsmade and Mr. R. P. Wentworth, who
handled the experimental work on camera mountings and
installation; Lieutenant A. H. Nietz, in charge of the
Langley Field Laboratory of the Experimental Department;
Mr. R. B. Wilsey and Lieutenant J. M. Hammond, who, with
Lieutenant Nietz, carried on the experimental work on
sensitized materials. A large part of what is new and what is
ascribed in the following chapters to “The American Air
Service” is the work of this group of men. Were individual
references made, in place of this general and inclusive one,
their names would thickly sprinkle these pages. It has been

<p class='c006'><strong>Aerial Photography from Balloons and Kites.</strong>—Photography
from the air had been developed and used to a limited
extent before the Great War, but with very few exceptions
the work was done from kites, from balloons, and from
dirigibles. Aerial photographs of European cities had
figured to a small extent in the illustration of guidebooks,
and some aerial photographic maps of cities had been made,
notably by the Italian dirigible balloon service. Kites had
been employed with success to carry cameras for photographing
such objects as active volcanoes, whose phenomena
could be observed with unique advantage from the air,
and whose location was usually far from balloon or
dirigible facilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a result of this pre-war work we had achieved some
knowledge of real scientific value as to photographic conditions
from the air. Notable among these discoveries was
the existence of a veil of haze over the landscape when seen
from high altitudes, and the consequent need for sensitive
emulsions of considerable contrast, and for color-sensitive
plates to be used with color filters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The development of aerial photography would probably
however have advanced but little had it depended merely
on the balloon or the kite. As camera carriers their limitations
are serious. The kite and the captive balloon cannot
navigate from place to place in such a way as to permit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>rapid or continuous photography of extended areas. The
kite suffers because the camera it supports must be manipulated
either from the ground or else by some elaborate
mechanism, both for pointing and for handling the exposing
and plate changing devices. The free balloon is at the
mercy of the winds both as to its direction and its speed of
travel. The dirigible balloon, as it now exists after its
development during the war, is, it is true, not subject to the
shortcomings just mentioned. Indeed, in many ways it is
perhaps superior to the airplane for photographic purposes,
since it affords more space for camera and accessories, and
is freer from vibration. It is capable also of much slower
motion, and can travel with less danger over forests and
inaccessible areas where engine failure would force a plane
down to probable disaster. But the smaller types as at
present built are not designed to fly so high as the airplane,
and the dirigibles, both large and small, are far more expensive
in space and maintenance than the plane. For this
one reason especially they are not likely to be the most
used camera carriers of the aerial photographer of the future.
Inasmuch as the photographic problems of the plane are
more difficult than those of the dirigible and at the same time
broader, the subject matter of this book applies with equal
force to photographic procedure for dirigibles.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Development of Airplane Photography in the Great War.</strong>—The
airplane has totally changed the nature of warfare.
It has almost eliminated the element of surprise, by rendering
impossible that secrecy which formerly protected the
accumulation of stores, or the gathering of forces for the
attack, a flanking movement or a “strategic retreat.” To
the side having command of the air the plans and activities
of the enemy are an open book. It is true that more is
heard of combats between planes than of the routine task
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>of collecting information, and the public mind is more apt
to be impressed by the fighting and bombing aspects of
aerial warfare. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the chief
use of the airplane in war is <em>reconnaissance</em>. The airplane is
“the eye of the army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the early days of the war, observation was visual. It
was the task of the observer in the plane to sketch the outlines
of trenches, to count the vehicles in a transport train,
to estimate the numbers of marching men, to record the
guns in an artillery emplacement and to form an idea of
their size. But the capacity of the eye for including and
studying all the objects in a large area, particularly when
moving at high speed, was soon found to be quite too small
to properly utilize the time and opportunities available in
the air. Moreover, the constant watching of the sky for the
“Hun in the sun” distracted the observer time and time
again from attention to the earth below. Very early in the
war, therefore, men's minds turned to photography. The
all-seeing and recording eye of the camera took the place
of the observer in every kind of work except artillery fire
control and similar problems which require immediate
communication between plane and earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>The volume of work done by the photographic sections
of the military air service steadily increased until toward
the end of the war it became truly enormous. The aerial
negatives made per month in the British service alone
mounted into the scores of thousands, and the prints distributed
in the same period numbered in the neighborhood
of a million. The task of interpreting aerial photographs
became a highly specialized study. An entirely new activity—that
of making photographic mosaic maps and of maintaining
them correct from day to day—usurped first place
among topographic problems. By the close of the war
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>scarcely a single military operation was undertaken without
the preliminary of aerial photographic information. Photography
was depended on to discover the objectives for
artillery and bombing, and to record the results of the subsequent
“shoots” and bomb explosions. The exact configurations
of front, second, third line and communicating
trenches, the machine gun and mortar positions, the “pill
boxes,” the organized shell holes, the listening posts, and
the barbed wire, were all revealed, studied and attacked
entirely on the evidence of the airplane camera. Toward the
end of the war important troop movements were possible
only under the cover of darkness, while the development
of high intensity flashlights threatened to expose even
these to pitiless publicity.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Limitations to Airplane Photography Set by War Conditions.</strong>—The
ability of the pilot to take the modern high-powered
plane over any chosen point at any desired altitude
in almost any condition of wind or weather gives to the plane
an essential advantage over the photographic kites and
balloons of pre-war days. There are, however, certain disadvantages
in the use of the plane which must be overcome
in the design of the photographic apparatus and in the
method of its use. Some few of these disadvantages are
inherent in the plane itself; for instance, the necessity for
high speed in order to remain in the air, and the vibration
due to the constantly running engine. Others are peculiar
to war conditions, and their elimination in planes for peace-time
photography will give great opportunities for the
development of aerial photography as a science.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chief among the war-time limitations is that of economy
of space and weight. A war plane must carry a certain
equipment of guns, radio-telegraphic apparatus and other
instruments, all of which must be readily accessible. Many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>planes have duplicate controls in the rear cockpit to enable
the observer to bring the plane to earth in case of accident
to the pilot. Armament and controls demand space which
must be subtracted from quarters already cramped, so that
in most designs of planes the photographic outfit must be
accommodated in locations and spaces wretchedly inadequate
for it. Economy in weight is pushed to the last extreme,
for every ounce saved means increased ceiling and
radius of action, a greater bombing load, more ammunition,
or fuel for a longer flight. Hence comes the constant pressure
to limit the weight of photographic and other apparatus,
even though the tasks required of the camera constantly call
for larger rather than smaller equipment.</p>

<p class='c000'>To another military necessity is due in great measure
the forced development of aerial photographic apparatus
in the direction of automatic operation. The practice of
entrusting the actual taking of the pictures to observers
with no photographic knowledge, whose function was
merely to “press the button” at the proper time, necessitated
cameras as simple in operation as possible. The
multiplicity of tasks assigned to the observer, and in particular
the ever vital one of watching for enemy aircraft, made
the development of largely or wholly automatic cameras
the war-time ideal of all aerial photographic services.
Whether the freeing of the observer from other tasks will
relegate the necessarily complex and expensive automatic
camera to strictly military use remains to be seen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>An essential part of the equipment of either the aerial
photographer or the designer of aerial photographic apparatus
is a working knowledge of the principles and construction
of the airplane, and considerable actual experience in the air.
Conditions and requirements in the flying plane are far
different from those of the shop bench or photographic
studio. As a preliminary to undertaking any work on airplane
instruments a good text-book on the principles of
flight should be studied. Such general ideas as are necessary
for understanding the purely photographic problems are,
however, outlined in the next paragraphs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span><strong>Construction of the Airplane.</strong>—The modern airplane
(Fig. <a href='#fig_001'>1</a>) consists of one or more <em>planes</em>, much longer across
than in the direction of flight (<em>aspect ratio</em>). These are
inclined slightly upward toward the direction of travel, and
their rapid motion through the air, due to the pull of the
<em>propeller</em> driven by the <em>motor</em>, causes them to rise from the
earth, carrying the <em>fuselage</em> or body of the airplane. In the
fuselage are carried the pilot, observer, and any other load.
Wheels below the fuselage forming the <em>under-carriage</em> or
<em>landing gear</em> serve to support the body when running along
the ground in taking off or landing. The pilot, sitting in
one of the <em>cockpits</em>, has in front of him the <em>controls</em>, by means
of which the motion of the plane is guided (Figs. <a href='#fig_002'>2</a> and <a href='#fig_003'>3</a>).
These consist of the engine controls—the <em>contacts</em> for the
ignition, the <em>throttle</em>, the oil and gasoline supply, air pressure,
etc., and the steering controls—the <em>rudder bar</em>, the <em>stick</em>
and the <em>stabilizer control</em>. The rudder bar, operated by the
feet, controls both the <em>rudder</em> of the plane, which turns the
plane to right or left in the air, and the <em>tail skid</em>, for steering
on the ground. The <em>stick</em> is a vertical column in front of the
pilot which, when pushed forward or back, depresses or
raises the <em>elevator</em> and makes the machine dive or climb.
Thrown to either side it operates the <em>ailerons</em> or wing tips,
which cause the plane to roll about its fore and aft axis.
The stabilizer control is usually a wheel at the side of the
cockpit, whose turning varies the angle of incidence of the
small stabilizing plane in front of the elevator, to correct
the balance of the plane under different conditions of loading.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <em>fuselage</em> consists usually of a light hollow framework
of spruce or ash, divided into a series of bays or compartments
by upright members, connecting the <em>longerons</em>, which
are the four corner members, running fore and aft, of the
plane. Diagonally across the sides and faces of these bays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>are stretched taut piano wires, and the whole structure is
covered with canvas or linen fabric. Cross-wires and fabric
are omitted from the top of one or more bays to permit their
being used as cockpits for pilot and observer. In later designs
of planes the wire and fabric construction has been superseded
by ply-wood veneer, thereby strengthening the fuselage
so that many of the diagonal bracing wires on the inside
are dispensed with. This greatly increases the accessibility
of the spaces in which cameras and other apparatus must
be carried.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fuselage differs greatly in cross-section shape and in
roominess according to the type of engine. In the majority
of English and American planes, with their vertical cylinder
or V type engines, the fuselage is narrow and rectangular
in cross-section. In many French planes, radial or rotary
engines are used and the fuselage is correspondingly almost
circular, and so is much more spacious than the English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and American planes of similar power. The shape and size
of the plane body has an important bearing on the question
of camera installation.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Types of Planes.</strong>—The most common type of plane is
the <em>biplane</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_004'>4</a>), with its two planes, connected by struts
and wires, set not directly over each other, but <em>staggered</em>,
usually with the upper plane leading. <em>Monoplanes</em> were in
favor in the early days of aviation, and <em>triplanes</em> have been
used to some extent. According to the position of the
propeller planes are classified as <em>tractors</em> or <em>pushers</em>, tractors
being at present the more common form. Planes are further
classified as <em>single-seaters</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_005'>5</a>), <em>two-seaters</em>, and <em>three-seaters</em>.
These motor and passenger methods of classification are
now proving inadequate with the rapid development of
planes carrying two, three, and even more motors, divided
between pusher and tractor operation, and carrying increasingly
large numbers of passengers. Aside from structure,
planes may be further classified according to their uses, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span><em>scout</em>, <em>combat</em>, <em>reconnaissance</em>, <em>bombing</em>, etc. Planes equipped
with floats or pontoons for alighting on the water are called
<em>seaplanes</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_182'>182</a>), and those in which the fuselage is boat-shaped,
to permit of floating directly on the water, are
<em>flying boats</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_183'>183</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Plane in the Air.</strong>—The first flight of the photographic
observer or of the instrument expert who is to work upon
airplane instruments is very profitably made as a “joy ride,”
to familiarize him with conditions in the air. His experience
will be somewhat as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>The plane is brought out of the hangar, carefully gone
over by the mechanics, and the engine “warmed up.” The
pilot minutely inspects all parts of the “ship,” then climbs
up into the front cockpit. He wears helmet and goggles,
and if the weather is cold or if he expects to fly high, a heavy
wool-lined coat or suit, with thick gloves and moccasins, or
an electrically heated suit. The passenger, likewise attired,
climbs into the rear cockpit and straps himself into the seat.
He finds himself sitting rather low down, with the sides of
the cockpit nearly on a level with his eyes. To either side
of his knees and feet are taut wires leading from the controls
to the elevator, stabilizer, tail skid and rudder. If the
machine is dual control, the stick is between his knees, the
rudder bar before his feet. None of these must he let his
body touch, so in the ordinary two-seater his quarters are
badly cramped.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the word “contact” the mechanics swing the propeller,
and, sometimes only after several trials, the motor
starts, with a roar and a rush of wind in the passenger's face.
After a moment's slow running it is speeded up, the intermittent
roar becomes a continuous note, the plane shakes
and strains, while the mechanics hold down the tail to
prevent a premature take-off. When the engine is properly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>warmed up it is throttled to a low speed, the chocks under
the wheels are removed, the mechanics hold one end of the
lower wing so that the plane swings around toward the field.
It then “taxis” out to a favorable position facing into the
wind with a clear stretch of field before it. After a careful
look around to see that no other planes are landing, taking
off, or in the air near by, the pilot opens out the engine, the
roar increases its pitch, the plane moves slowly along the
ground, gathers speed and rises smoothly into the air. Near
the ground the air is apt to be “bumpy,” the plane may
drop or rise abruptly, or tilt to either side. The pilot instantly
corrects these deviations, and the plane continues to
climb until steadier air is reached.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first the passenger's chief impressions are apt to be the
deafening noise of the motor, the heavy vibration, the
terrific wind in his face. If he raises his hand above the
edge of the cockpit he realizes the magnitude of wind resistance
at the speed of the plane, and hence the importance
of the <em>stream-line section</em> of all struts and projecting parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he reaches the desired altitude the pilot levels off
the plane and ceases to climb. Now his task is to maintain
the plane on an even keel by means of the controls, correcting
as soon as he notes it, any tendency to “pitch,”
to “roll” or to “yaw” off the course. The resultant path
is one which approximates to level straight flying to a
degree conditioned by the steadiness of the air and the skill
of the pilot. If he is not skilful or quick in his reactions he
may keep the plane on its level course only by alternately
climbing and gliding, by flying with first one wing down and
then the other, by pointing to the right and then to the left.
The skilled photographic pilot will hold a plane level in
both directions to within a few degrees, but he will do this
easily only if the plane is properly balanced. If the load
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>on the plane is such as to move the center of gravity too far
forward with respect to the <em>center of lift</em> the plane will be <em>nose-heavy</em>,
if the load is too far back it will be <em>tail-heavy</em>. Either
of these conditions can be corrected, at some cost in efficiency,
by changing the inclination of the stabilizer. When the plane
reaches high altitudes in rare air, where it can go no further,
it is said to have reached its <em>ceiling</em>. It here travels level
only by pointing its wings upward in the climbing position,
so that the fuselage is no longer parallel to the direction of
flight. An understanding of these peculiarities of the plane
in flight is of prime importance in photographic map making,
where the camera should be accurately vertical at all times.</p>

<p class='c000'>The direction and velocity of the wind must be carefully
considered by the pilot in making any predetermined course
or objective. The progress of the plane due to the pull of
the propeller is primarily with reference to the air. If this
is in motion the plane's <em>ground speed</em> and direction will be
altered accordingly. In flying with or against the wind the
ground speed is the sum or difference, respectively, of the
plane's <em>air speed</em> (determined by an air speed indicator) and
the speed of the wind. If the predetermined course lies
more or less across the wind the plane must be pointed into
the wind, in which case its travel, with respect to the earth,
is not in the line of its fore and aft axis. The effect of “crabbing,”
as it is called, on photographic calculations is discussed
later (Figs. <a href='#fig_136'>136</a> and <a href='#fig_138'>138</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>When the plane has reached the end of its straight
course and starts to turn, its level position is for the moment
entirely given up in the operation of <em>banking</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_006'>6</a>).
Just as the tracks on the curve of a railroad are raised on
the outer side to oppose the tendency of the train to slip
outward, so the plane must be tilted, by means of the
ailerons, toward the inside of the turn. A point to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>clearly kept in mind about a bank is that if correctly made
a plumb line inside the fuselage will continue to hang
vertical <em>with respect to the floor of the plane, and not with
respect to the earth</em>, for the force acting on it is the combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of gravity and the acceleration outward due to the turn.
Only some form of gyroscopically controlled pointer, keeping
its direction in space, will indicate the inclination of the
plane with respect to the true vertical. If the banking is
insufficient the plane will <em>side slip</em> outward or <em>skid</em>; if too
great, it will side slip inward.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 6.</span>—Banking.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>As part of the “joy ride” the pilot may do a few “stunts,”
such as a “stall,” a “loop,” a “tail spin,” or an “Immelman.”
From the photographic standpoint these are of
interest in so far as they bear on the question of holding the
camera in place in the plane. The thing to be noted here is
that (particularly in the loop), if these maneuvers are
properly performed, there is little tendency toward relative
motion between plane and apparatus. In a perfect loop it
would, for instance, be unnecessary, due to the centrifugal
force outward, for the observer to strap himself in. It is,
however, <strong>un</strong>wise to place implicit confidence in the perfection
of the pilot's aerial gymnastics. No apparatus should be
left entirely free, although, for the reason given, comparatively
light fastenings are usually sufficient.</p>

<p class='c000'>When nearing the landing field the pilot will throttle
down the engine and commence to glide. If he is at a considerable
altitude he may come down a large part of the distance
in a rapid spiral. As the earth is approached the air
pressure increases rapidly, and the passenger, if correctly
instructed, will open his mouth and swallow frequently to
equalize the air pressure on his ear drums. Just before the
ground is reached the plane is leveled off, it loses speed, and,
if the landing is perfect, touches and runs along the ground
without bouncing or bumping. Frequently, however, the
impact of the tail is sufficiently hard to cause it to bump
badly, with a consequent considerable danger to apparatus
of any weight or delicacy. This is especially apt to occur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>in hastily chosen and poorly leveled fields such as must often
be utilized in war or in cross-country flying.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Appearance of the Earth from the Plane.</strong>—The view
from the ordinary two-seater is greatly restricted by the
engine in front and by the planes to either side and below
(Figs. <a href='#fig_007'>7</a>, <a href='#fig_008'>8</a>, and <a href='#fig_009'>9</a>). By craning his neck over the side, or
by looking down through an opening in the floor, the passenger
has an opportunity to learn the general appearance of
the subject he is later to devote his attention to photographing.
Perhaps the most striking impression he receives will
be that of the <em>flatness</em> of the earth, both in the sense of
absence of relief and in the sense of absence of extremes of
light and shade. The absence of relief is due to the fact
that at ordinary flying heights the elevations of natural
objects are too small for the natural separation of the eyes
to give any stereoscopic effect. The absence of extremes of
light and shade is in part due to the fact that the natural
surfaces of earth, grass and forest present no great range of
brightness; in part to the small relative areas of the parts
in shadow; in considerable part to the layer of atmospheric
haze which lies as an illuminated veil between the observer
and the earth at altitudes of 2000 meters and over (Figs.
<a href='#fig_010'>10</a> and <a href='#fig_011'>11</a>). Due to the combination of these factors the
earth below presents the appearance of a delicate pastel.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the gaze is directed away from the territory directly
below, the thickness of atmosphere to be pierced rapidly
increases, until toward the horizon (which lies level with
the observer here as on the ground) all detail is apt to be
obliterated to such an extent that only on very clear days
can the horizon itself be definitely found or be distinguished
from low lying haze or clouds (Fig. <a href='#fig_004'>4</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Airplane Instruments.</strong>—Mounted on boards in front of
the pilot and observer are various instruments to indicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>the performance of engine and plane (Fig. <a href='#fig_002'>2</a>). Those of
interest to the photographic observer are the <em>compass</em>, the
<em>altimeter</em>, the <em>air speed indicator</em>, the <em>inclinometers</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <em>compass</em> is usually a special airplane compass, with
its “card” immersed in a damping liquid. Like most of the
direction indicating instruments on a plane its indications
are only of significance when the plane is pursuing a steady
course. On turns or rapid changes of direction of any sort
perturbations prevent accurate reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>altimeter</em> is of the common aneroid barometer type.
On American instruments it is usually graduated to read in
100-foot steps. While somewhat sluggish, it is quite satisfactory
for all ordinary determinations of altitude in photographic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>work. Were primary map making to be undertaken,
where the scale was determinable only from the altitude and
focal length of the lens, the ordinary altimeter is hardly
accurate enough.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The <em>air speed indicator</em> consists of a combination of
Venturi and Pitot tubes, producing a difference of pressure
when in motion through the air which is measured on a
scale calibrated in air speed. This instrument is important
for determining, in combination with wind speed, the
<em>ground speed</em> of the plane, on the basis of which is calculated
the interval between exposures to secure overlapping
photographs. Its accuracy is well above that necessary
for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><em>Inclinometers</em> for showing the lateral and fore and aft
angle of the plane with the horizontal, are occasionally used,
and have also been incorporated in cameras. The important
point to remember about these instruments is that they are
controlled not alone by gravity but as well by the acceleration
of the plane in any direction. They consequently
indicate correctly only when the plane is flying straight.
On a bank the lateral indicator continues to indicate “vertical”
if the bank is properly calculated for the turn.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Chief Uses of an Airplane Camera.</strong>—The kinds of
camera suitable for airplane use and the manner in which
they must differ from cameras for use on the ground are
determined by consideration of the nature of the work they
must do. Four kinds of pictures constitute the ordinary
demands upon the aerial photographer. These are single
objectives or <em>pin points</em>, <em>mosaic maps</em> of strips of territory
or large areas, <em>oblique views</em>, and <em>stereoscopic views</em>. Each
of these presents its own peculiar problems influencing
camera design.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pinpoints</em> consist of such objects as gun emplacements,
railway stations, ammunition dumps, and other objects of
which photographs of considerable magnification are desired
for study. Here the instrumental requirements are <em>sufficient
focal length of lens</em> to secure an image of adequate size;
<em>means for pointing</em> the camera accurately; enough <em>shutter
speed</em> to counterbalance the speed of the plane; sufficiently
<em>wide lens aperture</em> to give adequate exposure with the shutter
speed required; <em>means of supporting</em> the camera to protect
it from the vibration of the plane.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Mosaic maps</em> are built up from a large number of photographs
of adjacent areas. In addition to the above requirements,
mosaic maps demand <em>lenses free from distortion</em> and
covering as large a plate as possible, in order to keep to a
minimum the number of pictures needed to cover a given
area; means for keeping the camera <em>accurately vertical</em>, and
means for <em>changing the plates or films</em> and resetting the
shutter rapidly enough to avoid gaps between successive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>pictures. At low altitudes and high ground speeds the interval
between exposures becomes a matter of only a few seconds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Oblique views</em> are made at angles of from 12 to 35 degrees
from the horizontal, usually from comparatively low altitudes.
They have been found to be particularly suitable for
the use of men who have no training in photographic interpretation,
being more like the pictures with which the men
are familiar. Distributed among the infantry before an
attack, they have proved indispensable aids to the proper
knowledge of the ground to be covered. The additional requirement
here is for <em>high shutter speed</em> to eliminate the effect
of the relatively very rapid movement of the foreground.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Stereoscopic views</em> are among the most useful of all airplane
pictures. They are made from successive exposures,
the separation of the points of view being obtained not by
two lenses at the distance of the eyes apart, but by the
motion of the plane. For this purpose the views should
overlap by at least 60 per cent; this, therefore, requires a very
<em>short interval between exposures</em>. For stereo-oblique views
this may mean that they are taken at intervals as short as
one or two seconds.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Chief Differences between Ground and Air Cameras.</strong>—Certain
definite differences are thus seen to stand out between
airplane cameras and the ordinary kind. It is essential
that the apparatus for use in the air shall have high lens and
shutter speed, means for rapid changing of plates, and anti-vibration
suspension. Without these features a camera is
of little use for aerial work. These requirements lead inevitably
to greater complexity of design. One simplification
over ground cameras, however, is brought about by the fact
that all exposures are made on objects beyond the practical
infinity point of the lens; consequently, all cameras are fixed
focus. This fixed focus feature is a positive advantage in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>construction, since it permits of the simple rigid box form,
desirable and necessary to withstand the strains due to the
weight of the lens and the stresses from the plane. But with
the abandonment of all provision for focussing in the air
must go special care that the material used in constructing
the camera body is as little subject as possible to expansion
and contraction with temperature, since there is often a
drop of 30 to 40 degrees Centigrade from ground to upper
air. The effect of change of temperature on focus will be
treated in the discussion of lenses.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to these differences, we must keep in mind certain
requirements which are conditioned by the nature and
place of aerial navigation. Thus all mechanical devices which
will fail to function at the low temperatures and pressures met
at high altitudes are entirely unsuitable. Experience has
shown, too, that we must avoid all mechanism depending
primarily on <em>springs</em> and on the action of <em>gravity</em>. Vibration,
and the motion of the plane in all three dimensions, conspire
to render mechanical motions unreliable when actuated by
these agencies. All plate changing, shutter setting, and
exposing operations should be as nearly as possible positively
controlled motions. Because of the cold of the upper air
all knobs, levers and catches must be made extra large and
easy to handle with heavy gloves. Circular knurled heads
to such parts as shutter setting movements are to be avoided
in favor of bat-wing keys or levers. Grooves for the reception
of magazines must be as large and smooth as possible,
and guides to facilitate the magazines' introduction should
be provided (Fig. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a>). No releases or adjustments which
depend upon hearing or upon a delicate sense of touch are
feasible in airplane apparatus. Wherever possible, large
<em>visible</em> indicators of the stage of the cycle of operations should
be provided. Loose parts are to be shunned, as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>invariably lost in service. Complete operating instructions
should be placed on the apparatus wherever possible,
to minimize the confusion due to changing and
uninstructed personnel.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Elements of the Airplane Camera.</strong>—Disregarding
its means of suspension, the airplane camera proper consists
essentially of <em>lens</em>, <em>camera body</em>, <em>shutter</em>, and <em>plate or film
holding and changing box</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In certain of the aerial cameras developed early in the
war all of these elements were built together in a common
enclosure. Later it was generally recognized that a unit
system of interchangeable parts is preferable. In the case
of the lens there arose various requirements for focal length,
from 25 to 120 centimeters, according to the work to be
done. Rather than use an entirely different camera for each
different kind of work, it is better to have lenses of various
focal lengths, mounted in tubes or cones, all built to attach
to the same camera body. In the case of the shutter it is
desirable to be able to repair or calibrate periodically. By
making the shutter a removable unit, the provision of a few
spares does away with the need for putting the whole
camera out of commission. Similar considerations hold
with reference to other parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>A further material advantage that comes from making
airplane cameras in sections is the greater ease with which
they are inserted in the plane, usually through the openings
between diagonal cross-wires. It is in fact only by virtue
of this possibility of breaking up into small elements that
some of the larger cameras could be inserted in the common
types of reconnaissance plane. Illustrations of the building
up of cameras from separate removable elements are given
in the detailed discussion of the individual types.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Types of Airplane Cameras.</strong>—During the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the war airplane cameras have been classified on various
bases, in different services. In the French service, where
the deMaria type of camera was standardized early in the
war, the usual classification was based on focal length;
thus the standard cameras were spoken of as the 26, the 50
and the 120 (centimeter). A further distinction was then
made according to the size of plate, this being originally
13 × 18 centimeters for the 26 centimeter, and 18 × 24
centimeters for the larger cameras. In the English service
the 4 × 5 inch plate was used almost exclusively, and their
various types of cameras were known by serial letters—C, E,
L, etc. Both these modes of classification became inadequate
with the ultimate agreement to standardize on the
18 × 24 centimeter size for all plates, and to carry lenses of
all focal lengths in interchangeable elements.</p>

<p class='c000'>For purposes of description and discussion, it is most
convenient to classify cameras according to their method of
operation and the sensitive material employed. On this
basis we may distinguish among cameras using <em>plates</em>
three kinds—<em>non-automatic cameras</em>, <em>semi-automatic cameras</em>,
and <em>automatic cameras</em>. We may similarly discuss <em>film
cameras</em>, but having treated the plate cameras comprehensively,
it will be found that the discussion of all types of film
camera can be handled most conveniently by studying the
differences in construction and operation introduced by the
characteristics of film as compared to plates.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>LENSES FOR AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>General Considerations.</strong>—The design and selection of
lenses for aerial photography present on the whole no
problems not already encountered in photography of the
more familiar sort. Indeed, the lens problem in the airplane
camera is in some particulars more simple than in the ground
camera. For instance, there is no demand for depth of focus—all
objects photographed are well beyond the usually
assumed “infinity focus” of 2000 times the lens diameter.
Such strictly scientific problems of design as pertain to
aerial photographic lenses are ones of degree rather than of
kind. Larger aperture, greater covering power, smaller
distortion, more exquisite definition—these always will be
in demand, and each progressive improvement will be
reflected in advances in the art of aerial photography. But
many lens designs perfected before the war were admirably
suited, without any change at all, for aerial cameras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the utmost seriousness, however, with the Allies, was
the problem of securing lenses of the desired types in sufficient
numbers. The manufacture of the many varieties of
optical glass essential to modern photographic lenses was
almost exclusively a German industry, which had to be
learned and inaugurated in Allied countries since 1914. In
consequence of this entirely practical problem of quantity
production without the glasses for which lens formulæ were
at hand, some new lens designs were produced. Whether
any of these possess merits which will lead them to be preferred
over pre-war designs, when the latter can again be
manufactured, remains to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>While the glass problem was still unsolved, aerial cameras
had to be equipped with whatever lenses could be secured
by requisition from pre-war importation and manufacture,
and later, with lenses designed to utilize those glasses whose
manufacture had been mastered in the allied countries. It
is important that the historical aspect of this matter be well
understood by the student of aerial photographic methods,
for the use of these odd-lot lenses reacted on the whole
design of aerial cameras and on the methods of aerial photography,
particularly in England and the United States.
Almost without exception the available lenses were of short
focus, considered from the aerial photographic standpoint;
that is, they lay between eight and twelve inches. This set
a limit to the size of the airplane camera, quite irrespective of
the demands made by the nature of the photographic
problem. Lenses of these focal lengths produced images
which, for the usual heights of flying, were generally considered
too small, and which were, therefore, almost always
subsequently enlarged. Such was the English practice,
which was followed in the training of aerial photographers
in America, where exactly similar conditions held at the
start with respect to available lenses. French glass and lens
manufacturers did succeed in supplying lenses of longer
focus (50 centimeters), in numbers sufficient for their own
service, although never with any certainty for their allies.
The French, therefore, almost from the start, built their
cameras with lenses of long focus, and made contact prints
from their negatives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Practices adopted under pressure of an emergency to
meet temporary practical limitations often come to dominate
the whole situation. This is particularly true of aerial
photography in the British and American services. The
small apparatus built around the stop-gap short focus lenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>fixed the plane designer's idea of an airplane camera, and the
space it should occupy. This was directly reflected in the
designs of the English planes, and the American planes
copied after them. Meanwhile the American photographic
service in France associated itself with the French service,
adopting its methods and apparatus, and using French
planes whose designs were not being followed in American
construction. The task of harmonizing the photographic
practice as taught in America, following English lines,
with French practice as followed in the theater of war, and of
adapting planes built on English designs so that they could
carry French apparatus, was a formidable one, not likely to
be soon forgotten by any who had a part in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Photographic Lens Characteristics.</strong>—Whole volumes have
been written on the photographic lens, and on the optical
science utilized and indeed brought into being by its problems.
Such works should be consulted by those who intend
to make a serious study of the design of lenses for aerial
use. No more can be attempted, no more indeed is relevant
here, than an outline review of the chief characteristics and
errors of photographic lenses, considering them with special
reference to aerial needs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The modern photographic lens is, broadly speaking, a
development of the simple convex or converging lens. Its
function is the same: to form a real image of objects placed
before it. But the difference in performance between the
simple lens and the modern photographic objective is enormous.
The simple lens forms a clear image only close to
its axis, for light of a single color, and as long as its aperture
is kept quite small as compared to the distance at which
the image is formed. The photographic lens, on the other
hand, is called upon to produce a clear image with light of
a wide range of spectral composition, sharply defined over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>a flat surface of large area, and it must do this with an aperture
that is large in comparison with the focal length,
whereby the amount of light falling on the image surface
shall be a maximum. This ideal is approximated to a really
extraordinary degree by the scientific combination and
arrangement of lens elements made from special kinds of
glass in the best photographic lenses of the anastigmat type.
The result is of necessity a set of compromises, whereby the
outstanding errors are reduced to a size judged permissible
in view of the work the lens is to do. These errors or <em>aberrations</em>
are briefly reviewed below, in order that the reader
may readily grasp the terms in which the performance and
tolerances in aerial lenses are described.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Spherical Aberration and Coma.</em>—Suppose we focus on a
screen, by means of a simple convex lens the image of a
distant point of light. Suppose for simplicity that this
image is located on the axis of the lens and that light of only
one color is used, such as yellow. It will be found that the
smallest image that can be obtained is not a point, but a
small disc. This is due to the fact that the rays of light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>passing through the outer portions of the lens are bent more
than those passing through the lens in the region near the
center. This effect is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_012'>12</a> by the usual mode of
representing it graphically. Here the figures 1, 2, 3, 4,
represent distances from the axis of the lens, and the letters
A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, the points of convergence of the rays from
1, 2, 3, 4, etc. These distances projected upward on to the
produced lens points form a curve which shows at a glance
the extent and direction of the error due to each part of the
lens. This information is of value where the lens is fitted
with an adjustable diafram. With some types of correction
sharper definition may be obtained by reducing the aperture.
With others, however, diaframing impairs definition, by destroying
the balance between under and over correction
which averages to make a good image. In aerial lenses it
is not customary to use diaframs, as all the light possible is
desired. Consequently the reduction of spherical aberration
must be accomplished by proper choice of lens elements and
their arrangement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Off the axis of the lens the image of a point source takes
on an irregular shape, due to oblique spherical aberration
or <em>coma</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Chromatic Aberration.</em>—Because of the inherent properties
of the glass of which it is made, a simple collective lens
does not behave in the same way with respect to light of
different colors. If one attempts, with such a lens, to focus
upon a screen the image of a distant white light, it will be
found that the blue rays will not focus at the same point
as the red rays, but will come together nearer the lens.
Modern photographic lenses are compounded of two or
more kinds of glass in such a way as to largely eliminate
this defect, the presence of which is detrimental to good
definition. Such lenses are called achromatic, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>property of a lens by virtue of which this defect is eliminated
is called its <em>chromatic correction</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Chromatic correction is never perfect, but two colors
of the spectrum can be brought to a focus in the same
plane, and to a certain extent the departure of other
colors from this plane can be controlled. Off the axis of
the lens outstanding chromatic aberration results in a
difference in the size of images of different colors, known as
<em>lateral chromatism</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like spherical aberration, chromatic aberration is a
contributing factor to the size of the image of a point source,
which determines the defining power of a lens. It is, however,
an error whose effect is to some extent dependent on the
kind of sensitive plate used. Two lenses may give images
of the same size (in so far as it is governed by chromatic
aberration), if a plate of narrow spectral sensitiveness is
used, while giving images of different size on panchromatic
plates of more extended color sensibility. The choice of the
region of the spectrum for which chromatic correction is to
be made is thus governed by the color of the photographically
effective light. While in ordinary photography the blue
of the spectrum is most important, in aerial work where
color filters are habitually used with isochromatic plates
the green is most important, and color correction centered
about this region constitutes a real difference of design
peculiar to aerial lenses. Similarly the general use of deep
orange or red filters with red sensitive plates, for heavy mist
penetration, would call for a shift of correction to that part
of the spectrum.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Astigmatism and Covering Power.</em>—Suppose the lens
forms at some point off its axis an image of a cross. Suppose
one of the elements of the cross to be on a radius from the
center of the field, the other element parallel to a tangent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The rays forming the images of these two elements of the
cross are subject to somewhat different treatment in their
passage through the lens. The curvature of the lens surfaces
is on the whole greater with respect to the rays from
the radial element than to those from the tangential element.
They are therefore refracted more strongly and come to a
focus nearer the lens. The arms of the cross are consequently
not all in focus at once. This error, termed <em>astigmatism</em>,
is rather well shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_015'>15</a>, where the images of
the outlying concentric circles are sharp in the radial, but
blurred in the tangential direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Astigmatism can be largely compensated for, and its
character controlled. The most usual correction brings
the two images in focus together both at the axis, and on a
circle at some distance out. This second locus of coincidence
may or may not be in the same plane as the first, depending
on which disposition produces the best average correction.
The mean between the two foci determines the focal plane
of the lens, which is in general somewhat curved. The
<em>covering power</em> of a lens is given by the size of the field which
is sufficiently flat and free from astigmatism for the purpose
for which the lens is used. This is largely determined by
the astigmatism, but the other aberrations are also important.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Illumination.</em>—The amount of light concentrated by the
lens on each elementary area of the image determines its
brightness or illumination. The ideal image would, of course,
be equally bright over its whole area of good definition, and
for lenses of narrow angle this is approximately true. But
when it is desired to cover a wide angle the question of illumination
becomes serious. The relationship between angle
from the axis and illumination is that illumination is proportional
to the fourth power of the cosine of the angle.
This relationship is shown in the following table:</p>

<p class='c000'>If the field of view is 60°, which corresponds to an 18 × 24
centimeter plate with a lens of 25 centimeter focus, the
brightness is only 56 per cent., and the necessary exposure
at the edge approximately 1.8 times that at the center.
This effect is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_015'>15</a>. It is very noticeable if the
exposure is so short as to place the outlying areas in the
under-exposure period.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 13.</span>—Barrel and pin-cushion distortion.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Distortion.</em>—Sometimes a lens is relatively free from all
the aberrations, mentioned above, so that it gives sharp,
clear images on the plate, yet these images may not be
exactly similar to the objects themselves as regards their
geometrical proportions; in other words, the image will
show distortion. Lens distortion assumes two typical
forms, illustrated in Fig. <a href='#fig_013'>13</a>, which shows the result of
photographing a square net-work with lenses suffering in
the one case from “barrel” distortion and in the other
from “pin-cushion” distortion. In the first the corners are
drawn in relative to the sides; in the latter case the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>sides are drawn in with respect to the corners. Either sort
is a serious matter in precision photography, such as aerial
photographic mapping aspires to become. It must be
reduced to a minimum and its amount must be accurately
known if negatives are to be measured for the precise location
of photographed objects. In general symmetrical lenses
give less distortion than the unsymmetrical (Fig. <a href='#fig_014'>14</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Lens Testing and Tolerances for Aerial Work.</strong>—Simple
and rapid comparative tests of lenses may be made by
photographing a <em>test chart</em>, consisting of a large flat surface
on which are drawn various combinations of geometrical
figures—lines, squares, circles, etc.—calculated to show up any
failures of defining power. For testing aerial lenses the
chart should be as large as possible, so that it may be photographed
at a distance great enough for the performance of
the lens to be truly representative of its behavior on an
object at infinite distance. This means in practice a chart
of 4 or 5 meters side, to be photographed at a distance 20
to 30 times the focal length of the lens.</p>

<div id='fig_015'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 15.</span>—Photograph of a lens testing chart, showing failure in defining power outside area for which the lens is calculated.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A typical photograph of such a chart is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_015'>15</a>.
It reveals at a glance the more conspicuous lens errors.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>At the sides and corners the concentric circles show the
lens's astigmatism, by the clear definition of the lines radial
to the center of the field and their blurring in the tangential
direction. The falling off in illumination with increasing
distance from the center is also exhibited; and the blurring
of all detail outside the rectangle for which the lens was
calculated shows that spherical, chromatic, and other
aberrations have become prohibitively large.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the only complete test of a lens is the quantitative
measurement of errors made on an optical bench. A point
source of light, which may at will be made of any color of
the spectrum, is used as the object and its image formed by
the lens in a position where it can be accurately measured
for location, size, and shape by a microscope. A chart
giving the results of such a test is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_016'>16</a>. In the
upper left-hand corner is shown the position of the focus for
the different colors of the spectrum. Below this is recorded
the lateral chromatism at 21 degrees, in terms of the difference
in focus for a red and a blue ray. Below this again
comes the distortion, or shift of the image from its proper
position, for various angles (plotted at the extreme right)
from the lens axis. To the right of this is the image size, at
each angle, and finally, to the right of the diagram, are
plotted the distances of the two astigmatic foci from the
focal plane, together with the mean of the two foci, which
practically determines the shape of the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>An important point to notice is that these data are
uniformly plotted in terms of a lens of 100 millimeters focal
length irrespective of the actual focal length of the lens
measured. Thus this particular chart is for a 50 centimeter
lens but would be plotted on the same scale for a 25 or a
100 centimeter lens. Underlying this practice is the assumption
that all the characteristics of lenses of the same design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and aperture are directly proportional to their focal length.
If this were so, then a 50 centimeter lens would give double
the size of image that a 25 centimeter does, and so on.
As a matter of fact, test shows that the size of the image
does not increase so rapidly as the focal length; so that
while the image size for a 25 centimeter lens would be, say,
.05 millimeters per 100 millimeters focal length, it will be
only .03 or .04 millimeters per 100 millimeters focal length
for a 50 centimeter lens. The actual size of a point image
will therefore be greater, though not proportionately greater.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 16.</span>—Chart recording measurements of lens characteristics.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The chart presents tests on a good quality lens, and so
gives a good idea of the permissible magnitude of the various
errors. In many ways the most important figure is that for
image size, including as it does the result of all the aberrations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>In the example given, this varies from .075 to .15
mm. actual size. For the same type of lens of 25 centimeters
focus this range will be from .05 to .10 mm. Since
these are commonly used focal lengths, a good average
figure for image size, commonly used in aerial photographic
calculations, is ⅒ mm. In regard to astigmatic tolerances,
the two astigmatic foci should not be separated at any point
by more than 6 to 7 millimeters, and the mean of these
should not deviate from the true flat field by more than ½
millimeter, in each case the figures being based on the conventional
100 millimeters focal length. Distortion should
not be over .08 millimeter at 18° or .20 millimeter at 24°
from the axis (per 100 millimeters focal length).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Lens Aperture.</strong>—In the simple lens the aperture is
merely the diameter. In compound lenses the aperture
is not the linear opening but the effective opening of an
internal diafram. Photographically, however, aperture has
come to have a more extensive meaning. While in the
telescope the actual diameter of an objective is perhaps
the most important figure, and in the microscope the focal
length, in photography the really important feature is the
amount of light or illumination. This is determined by
lens opening and focal length together; specifically, by the
ratio of the lens area to the focal length. The common
system of representing photographic lens aperture is by the
ratio of focal length to lens diameter, the lens being assumed
to be circular. Thus F/5 (often written F.5) indicates that
the diameter is one-fifth the focal length.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two points are to be constantly borne in mind in connection
with this system of representation. First, all lenses
of the same aperture (as so represented) give the same
illumination of the plate (except for differences due to loss
of light by absorption and reflection in the lens system).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>This follows simply from the fact that the illumination of
the plate is directly proportional to the square of the lens
diameter, and inversely as the square of the focal length.
Secondly, the illumination of the plate is inversely as the
square of the numerical part of the expression for aperture.
That is, lenses of aperture F/4.5 and F/6 give images of
relative brightness (<span class='overunder'>6<br /><span class='ov'>4.5</span></span>)<sup>2</sup> = 1.78.</p>

<p class='c000'>What lens aperture, and therefore what image brightness,
is feasible, is determined chiefly by the angular field that
must be covered with any given excellence of definition.
The largest aperture ordinarily used for work requiring good
definition and flat field free from distortion is F/4.5. Anastigmatic
lenses of this aperture cover an angle of 16°
to 18° from the axis satisfactorily, which corresponds to an
18 × 24 centimeter plate with a lens of 50 centimeters focus.
Lenses with aperture as large as F/3.5 were used to some
extent in German hand cameras of 25 centimeters focal length,
with plates of 9 × 12 centimeters. English and American
lenses of this latter focal length were commonly of aperture
F/4.5, designed to cover a 4 × 5 inch plate.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a general rule the greater the focal length the smaller
the aperture—a relationship primarily due to the difficulty
of securing optical glass in large pieces. Thus while 50
centimeter lenses of aperture F/4.5 are reasonably easy to
manufacture, the practicable aperture for quantity production
is F/6, and for 120 centimeter lenses, F/10. This
means that a very great sacrifice of illumination must be
faced to secure these greater focal lengths. As is to be
expected from the state of the optical glass industry, the
German lenses were of generally larger aperture for the same
focal lengths than were those of the Allies. Besides the
F/3.5 lenses already mentioned, their 50 centimeter lenses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>were commonly of aperture F/4.8, their 120 centimeter
lenses of aperture F/7, or of about double the illuminating
power of the French lenses of the same size.</p>

<p class='c000'>Demands for large covering power also result in smaller
aperture. The 26 centimeter lenses used on French hand
cameras utilizing 13 × 18 centimeter plates were commonly
of aperture F/6 or F/5.6. The lens of largest covering power
decided on for use in the American service was of 12 inch
focus, to be used with an 18 × 24 centimeter plate (extreme
angle 26°); the largest satisfactory aperture for this lens
is F/5.6.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinarily the question of aperture is closely connected
with that of diaframs, whereby the lens aperture may be
reduced at will. Diaframs have been very little used in
aerial photography. All the aperture that can be obtained
and more is needed to secure adequate photographic action
with the short exposures required under the conditions of
rapid motion and vibration peculiar to the airplane. Any
excess of light, over the minimum necessary to secure proper
photographic action, is far better offset by increase of shutter
speed or by introduction of a color filter. For this reason
American aerial lenses were made without diaframs. In
the German cameras, however, adjustable diaframs are
provided (Fig. <a href='#fig_043'>43</a>), controlled from the top of the camera
by a rack and pinion. In the camera most used in the Italian
service an adjustable diafram is provided, but this is occasioned
by the employment of a between-the-lens shutter of
fixed speed, so that the only way exposure can be regulated
is by aperture variation, a method which has little to
recommend it.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Question of Focal Length.</strong>—In aerial photography
the lens is invariably used at fixed, infinity, focus. Under
these conditions the simple relationship holds that the size
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>of the image is directly proportional to the focal length and
inversely proportional to the altitude. If any chosen scale
is desired for the picture the choice of focal length is determined
by the height at which it is necessary to fly. This
at least would be the case were there no limitation to the
practicable focal length—which means camera size—and
were one limited to the original size of the picture as taken;
that is, were the process of enlargement not available. But
the possibility of using the enlarging process brings in other
questions: Is the defining power of a short focus lens as
good in proportion to its focal length as that of a long focus
lens? If so a perfect enlargement from a negative made by
a short focus lens would be identical with a contact print
from a negative made with a lens of longer focus. Is defining
power lost in the enlarging process with its necessary employment
of a lens which has its own errors of definition
and which must be accurately focussed?</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain factors which enter into comparisons of this
sort in other lines of work, such as astronomical photography,
play little part here. These are, first, the optical resolving
power of the lens, which is conditioned by the phenomena of
diffraction, and is directly as the diameter; and, second,
the size of the grain of the plate emulsion. The first of these
does not enter directly, because the size of a point image
on the axis of the lens, due merely to diffraction, is very
much less than that given by any photographic lens which
has been calculated to give definition over a large field, instead
of the minute field of the telescope. Yet it may contribute
toward somewhat better definition with a long focus lens
because of the actually larger diameter of such lenses. The
second factor is not important, because, as will be seen later,
the resolving power of the plates suitable for aerial photography
is considerably greater than that of the lens. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>emulsion grain is in fact only a quarter or a fifth the size of
the image as given by a 25 centimeter lens, and enlargements
of more than two or three times are rarely wanted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A series of experiments was made for the U. S. Air Service
to test out these questions, using a number of representative
lenses of all focal lengths, both at their working apertures
and at identical apertures for all. With regard to lens
defining power, as shown by the size of a point image, the
answer has already been reported in a previous section.
Lenses of long focus give a relatively smaller image than
lenses of the same design of short focus. In regard to the
whole process of making a small negative and enlarging it,
the loss of definition is quite marked, as compared to the
pictures of the same scale made by contact printing from
negatives taken with longer focus lenses.</p>

<p class='c000'>This answer is clear-cut only for lenses calculated to
give the same angular field. Thus a 10 inch lens covering a
4 × 5 inch plate has about the same angle as a 50 centimeter
lens for an 18 × 24 centimeter plate. When, however, it
comes to the longer foci, such as 120 centimeters, the practical
limitation to plate size (18 × 24 cm.) has been passed,
and the angular field is less than half that of the 50 centimeter
lens. The 120 centimeter lens need only be designed
for this small angle, with consequent greater opportunities
for reduction of spherical aberration. It is therefore an
open question whether a 50 centimeter lens designed to
cover a plate of linear dimensions <span class='overunder'>50<br /><span class='ov'>120</span></span> times that used with
the regular 50 centimeter lens could not be produced of such
quality that it would yield enlargements equal to contacts
from a 120 centimeter lens. If so, lenses of larger aperture
could be used, and a considerable saving in space requirements
effected.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Focal lengths during the Great War were decided by the
nature of the military detail which was to be revealed and
by the altitudes to which flying was restricted in military
operations. In the first three years of the war the development
of defences against aircraft forced planes to mount
steadily higher, so that the original three or four thousand
feet were pushed to 15,000, 18,000, and even higher. Lenses
of long focus were in demand, leading ultimately to the use
of some of as much as 120 centimeters (Fig. <a href='#fig_041'>41</a>). In the last
months of the war the resumption of open fighting made
minute recording of trench details of less weight, while the
preponderance of allied air strength permitted lower flying.
In consequence, lenses of shorter focus and wider angle came
to the fore, suitable for quick reconnaissance of the main
features of new country. At the close of the war the following
focal lengths were standard in the U. S. Air Service, and
may be considered as well-suited for military needs. Peace
may develop quite different requirements.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of the use of <em>telephoto lenses</em> in place of
lenses of long focus is frequently raised. Lenses of this type
combine a diverging (concave) element with the normal
converging system, whereby the effect of a long focus is
secured without an equivalent lens-to-plate distance. This
reduction in “back focus” may be from a quarter to a half.
Were it possible to obtain the same definition with telephoto
lenses as with lenses of the same equivalent focus, they
would indeed be eminently suitable for aerial work because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of their economy of length. But experience thus far has
shown that the performance of telephoto lenses, as to definition
and freedom from distortion, is distinctly inferior, so that
it is best to hold to the long focus lens of the ordinary type.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Lenses Suitable for Aerial Photography.</strong>—Among the
very large number of modern anastigmat lenses many were
found suitable for airplane cameras and were used extensively
in the war. A partial list follows: The Cooke Aviar,
The Carl Zeiss Tessar, the Goerz Dogmar, the Hawkeye
Aerial, the Bausch and Lomb Series Ic and IIb Tessars, the
Aldis Triplet, the Berthiot Olor.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Question of Plate Size and Shape.</strong>—Plate size is
determined by a number of considerations, scientific and
practical. If the type of lens is fixed by requirements as to
definition, then the dimensions of the plate are limited by
the covering power. From the standpoint of economy of
flights and of ease of recognizing the locality represented in a
negative, by its inclusion of known points, lenses of as wide
angle as possible should be used. If the focus is long, this
means large plates, which are bulky and heavy. If the
finest rendering of detail is not required a smaller scale
may be employed, utilizing short focus lenses and correspondingly
smaller plates. Thus a six inch focus lens on a 4 × 5 inch
plate would be as good from the standpoint of angular field
as a 12 inch on an 8 × 10 inch plate. This is apt to be the
condition with respect to most peace-time aerial photography,
which may be expected to free itself quickly from the huge
plates and cameras of war origin.</p>

<p class='c000'>For work in which great freedom from distortion of any
sort is imperative, small plates will be necessary, for two
reasons. One is that the characteristic lens distortions are
largely confined to the outlying portions of the field. The
other is that a wide angle of view inevitably means that all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>objects of any elevation at the edge of the picture are shown
partly in face as well as in plan, which prevents satisfactory
joining of successive views (Fig. <a href='#fig_128'>128</a>). In making a mosaic
map of a city, if a wide angle lens is employed with large
plates, the buildings lying along the junctions of the prints
can be matched up only for one level. If this is the ground
level, as it would be to keep the scale of the map correct,
the roofs will have to be sacrificed. In extreme cases a
house at the edge of a junction may even show merely as a
front and rear, with no roof, while in any case the abrupt
change at these edges from seeing one side of all objects to
seeing the opposite side is not pleasing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The table in a preceding section gives the relation of
plate size to focal length found best on the whole for military
needs. Deviations from these proportions in both directions
are met with. In the English service the LB camera, which
uses 4 × 5 inch plates, is equipped with lenses of various focal
lengths, up to 20 inches. The German practice, as well as
the Italian, was almost uniform use of 13 × 18 centimeter
plates for all focal lengths. Toward the end of the war,
however, some German cameras of 50 centimeter focal
length were in use employing plates 24 × 30 centimeters.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be recognized that these plate sizes are chosen
from those in common use before the war. A similar observation
holds with even greater force on the question of
plate <em>shape</em>. Current plate shapes have been chosen chiefly
with reference to securing pleasing or artistic effects with the
common types of pictures taken on the ground. These
shapes are not necessarily the best for aerial photography.
Indeed the whole question of plate shape should be taken up
from the beginning, with direct reference to the problems of
aerial photography and photographic apparatus.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few illustrations will make this clear, taking Fig. <a href='#fig_017'>17</a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>as a basis. If it is desired to do spotting (the photography
of single objectives), the best plate shape would be circular,
for that shape utilizes the entire covering area of the lens.
If it is desired to make successive overlapping pictures,
either for mapping, or for the production of stereoscopic
pairs, a rectangular shape is indicated. If the process of
plate changing is difficult or slow, it is advisable, in order
to give maximum time for
this operation, to have the
long side of the rectangle
parallel to the line of flight
(indicated by the arrow). If
economy of flights is a consideration,
as in making a mosaic
map of a large area, it is
advantageous to have as wide
a plate as the covering power
of the lens will permit. Reference
to Fig. <a href='#fig_017'>17</a> shows that
this means a plate of small dimensions
in the direction of
flight. If the changing of
plates or film is quick and
easy, the maximum use of the lens's covering power is made
by such a rectangle whose long side approximates the dimensions
of the lens field diameter. This is in fact the choice
made in the German film mapping camera (Figs. <a href='#fig_061'>61</a> and <a href='#fig_063'>63</a>),
whose picture is 6 × 24 centimeters. An objection to this from
the pictorial side, lies in the many junction lines cutting up
the mosaic. Another objection, if the plane does not hold
a steady course, is the failure to make overlaps on a turn.
(Fig. <a href='#fig_062'>62</a>.) Here as everywhere the problem is to decide on
the most practical compromise between all requirements.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span><strong>Focussing.</strong>—The process of focussing aerial cameras
was at first deemed a mystery, though undeservedly so.
A belief was long current that “ground” focus and “air”
focus differ. In other words, that a camera focussed upon a
distant object on the ground would not be in focus for an
object the same distance below the camera when in the
plane. Belief in this mysterious difference went so far that
certain instruction books describe in detail the process of
focussing a camera by trial exposures from the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>Careful laboratory tests performed for the U. S. Air
Service showed that neither low temperature nor low pressure,
such as would be met at high altitudes, alter the focus
of any ordinary lens by a significant amount, and that the
possible contraction of the camera body was of negligible
effect on the focus (not more than <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>200</span></span> per cent. per degree
centigrade with a metal camera). In complete harmony
with these tests has been the experience that if the ground
focussing is done carefully, by accurate means, then the air
focus is correct. The whole matter thus becomes one of
precision focussing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The best method, applicable if the air is steady, is to
focus by <em>parallax</em>. The ground glass focussing screen is
marked in the center with a pencilled cross. Over this is
mounted, with Canada balsam, a thin microscope cover-glass.
The camera is directed on an object a mile or more
away, and the image formed by the lens is examined by a
magnifying glass through the virtual hole formed by the
affixed cover-glass. With the pencil line in focus the head
is moved from side to side. If the image and pencil mark
coincide they will move together as the head is moved. If
the image moves away from the pencil mark and in the
<em>same</em> direction as the eye moves, the image is too near the
lens. If the image moves away in the <em>opposite</em> direction to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the motion of the eye, it is too far from the lens. In either
case the focus is to be corrected accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>In place of a distant object, which may waver with the
motion of the air, we may use an image placed at infinity
by optical means. The <em>collimator</em>, an instrument for doing
this, consists of a test object (lines, circles, etc.) placed
accurately at the focus of a telescope objective. The
camera lens is placed against this and focussed by parallax,
as with a distant object. Collimators are employed in camera
factories, and should be part of the equipment of base laboratories
where repairing and overhauling of cameras is done.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Lens Mounts.</strong>—All that is required for the mounting of
an aerial camera lens is a rigid platform, with provision for
enough motion of the lens to adjust its focus accurately.
As already explained, the lens works at fixed, infinity,
focus, and therefore needs no adjustment during use. It
must be held far more rigidly than would be possible by the
bellows, which is an almost invariable adjunct of focussing
cameras. The use of ordinary types of hand cameras on a
plane is rarely successful just because of the bellows, which
is strained and rattled by the rush of wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lens mountings thus far used have been simple
affairs. In the French cameras the lens is merely screwed
into a flange which in turn is fastened by screws to a platform
in the camera body. Adjustment for focussing is not
provided; instead, the flange is raised on thin metal rings or
washers, cut of such thickness by trial as to bring the lens
to focus, once and for all.</p>

<p class='c000'>The U. S. Air Service method of mounting is to provide
the lens barrel with a long thread, which screws into a
flange that in turn is mounted on a platform in the camera
cone, by means of thumb-screws. The lens is focussed by
screwing in and out, and then clamped by a screw through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the side, bearing on the thread. The whole mount may be
quickly removed by loosening the thumb-screws, and once
focussed in one cone, can be transferred to another similar,
machine-made cone without change of focus. Fig. <a href='#fig_018'>18</a>
shows a 20 inch lens mounted in this manner. The photograph
shows as well the ring on the front of the lens by
means of which circular color filters may be held in place.
This ring screws down on the filter, and the catch is dropped
into the nearest vertical groove to the tight position.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A somewhat different and better method of tightening
the lens in the flange, when focussed, has been adopted in the
English lens mount, which is in general similar to the
American. The threaded part of the flange is split by a slot
cut parallel to the flange base, and a screw is run into the flange
from the front, through the split portion. By tightening
this screw, which is always accessible, the split part of the
flange is squeezed together, thus rigidly holding the lens barrel.</p>

If flying is forced higher, a longer focus lens is used; if lower
flying is possible, a lens of shorter focus. This relationship
has, of course, been derived from war-time experience.
Probably much of the prospective peace-time mapping work
will impose substantially easier requirements as to definition
and will thus allow longer exposures.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>These figures will illustrate two important points:
they show how severe is the limitation as to exposure, with
the consequent heavy demand on lens and sensitive material
speed; and they show how important it is to secure a
shutter with the maximum light-giving power for a specified
length of exposure. This leads to a study of the characteristics
as to efficiency of the two common types of shutter,
namely, <em>shutters at or between the lens</em>, and <em>focal-plane shutters</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Characteristics of Shutters Located at the Lens.</strong>—Of the
various shutters located at the lens the most common is the
type that is clumsily but descriptively termed the “between-the-lens”
shutter. This is composed of thin hard rubber or
metal leaves or sectors which overlap and which are pulled
open to make the exposure. It may require two operations,
one for setting and one for exposing, or it may, as in some
makes, set and expose by a single motion. Clock escapements,
or some form of frictional resistance, are depended on
to control the interval between opening and closing. This
shutter is the one almost universally employed on small
hand cameras and on all lenses up to about two inches
diameter. It gives speeds sometimes marked as high as
<span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>300</span></span> second, although usually not over <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> on actual test.</p>

<p class='c000'>Between-the-lens shutters have been used to some extent
on the shorter focus (up to 25 centimeter) aerial cameras,
notably in the Italian service. They suffer, however, from
two limitations. In the first place we have not yet solved the
mechanical problems met with in trying to make the shutter
of large size (as for 50 centimeter <em>F</em>/6 lenses) at the same
time to give high speeds. In the second place the efficiency
of the type is low because a large part of the exposure time is
occupied by the opening and closing of the sectors.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we define the <em>efficiency</em> of a shutter as the ratio of the
amount of light it transmits during the exposure to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>amount of light it would transmit were it wide open during
the whole period, then the efficiency of the ordinary between-the-lens
shutter is of the order of 60 per cent. This means
1.6 times the motion of the image for the same photographic
action that we should have with a perfect shutter. The
accompanying photographic record (Fig. <a href='#fig_020'>20</a>) of the opening
and closing process of this type of shutter clearly illustrates
its deficiencies.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Characteristics of the Focal-Plane Shutter.</strong>—Long before
the days of aerial photography the problem of a high-efficiency
high-speed shutter for photographing moving
objects on the ground—railway trains or racing automobiles—had
already led to the development of the <em>focal-plane
shutter</em>. This is a type peculiarly adapted to the problems
of the airplane camera. It consists essentially of a curtain,
running at high speed close to the photographic plate, the
exposure being given by a narrow rectangular slot.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the focal-plane shutter is in virtual contact with the
sensitive surface the efficiency, as defined above, is 100 per
cent., since the whole cone of rays from the lens illuminates
the plate during the whole time of exposure. But if the
curtain is not carried close to the plate the efficiency falls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>off rapidly with distance, especially so for small apertures
of the slot.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of the necessity for <em>some</em> distance between shutter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and plate it is obviously important to keep <em>a</em> as large as
possible, depending for the requisite shutter speed on the
velocity of the curtain. Large aperture and high curtain
speed are also found to be desirable when we consider the
distortion produced by the focal-plane shutter.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Distortions Produced by the Focal-plane Shutter.</strong>—While
the time of exposure of any point on the plate can,
with the focal-plane shutter, easily be made <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> second or
less, the whole period during which the shutter is moving is
much greater than this. For instance, a 1 centimeter opening
which gives <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> second exposure takes ⅒ second to move
across a 10 centimeter plate, or nearly ⅕ second for an 18
centimeter plate. With a moving airplane this means that
the point of view at the end of the exposure has moved
forward compared to that at the beginning, by the amount
of motion of the plane in the interval. If the shutter moves
in the direction of motion of the plane the image will be
magnified; if in the opposite direction, it will be compressed
along the axis of motion. The amount of this distortion is
calculated as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>Let the velocity of the plane be <em>V</em>, and that of the shutter
be <em>v</em>. Let the focal length of the camera be <em>F</em>, and the
altitude <em>A</em>. If the camera were stationary, a plate of length
<em>l</em> would receive on its surface an image corresponding to a
distance <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>A</em></span><br /><em>F</em></span> × <em>l</em> on the ground. Due to the motion of the
shutter the end of the exposure occurs at a time <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>l</em></span><br /><em>v</em></span> after the
start. In this time the plane has moved a distance <em>V</em> × <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>l</em></span><br /><em>v</em></span>;
hence the point photographed at the end of the shutter
travel is <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>Vl</em></span><br /><em>v</em></span> within or beyond the original space covered
by the plate, depending on the direction of motion of the
curtain. The distortion, <em>D</em>, is given by the ratio of this distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>to the length corresponding to the normal stationary

<p class='c000'>As a percentage error this one per cent. is small compared
with other uncertainties, such as film shrinkage or the error
of level of the camera. As an absolute error in surveying,
thirty feet is, of course, excessive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The distortion is diminished for any specified shutter
speed by making the speed of travel of the curtain as large
as possible and by correspondingly increasing the aperture.
In connection with film cameras, another solution which
has been suggested is to move the film continuously during
the exposure in the direction of the plane's motion. The
requisite speed of the film <em>v'</em> to eliminate distortion is given
by the relation:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>For the values of <em>V</em>, <em>F</em>, and <em>A</em> used above, <em>v'</em> = .92 centimeters
per second. This speed is clearly that which holds
the image stationary on the film—a fact which suggests
another object for such movement, namely, to permit of
longer exposures.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>The effect of focal plane distortion may be averaged out
in the making of strip maps, if the shutter is constructed
so as to move in opposite directions on successive exposures.
The first picture will be magnified, the second compressed,
and so on, but a strip formed of accurately juxtaposed
pictures will be substantially accurate in over-all length.
Such a shutter is embodied in one of the German film
cameras (Fig. <a href='#fig_061'>61</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Distortion of the kind above discussed is absent with
between-the-lens shutters, which may conceivably be improved
in efficiency and in feasible size. If so they would
merit serious consideration for aerial mapping.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Methods and Apparatus for Testing Shutter Performance.</strong>—With
a focal-plane shutter the desirable qualities in
performance are three in number: (1) <em>Adequate speed range</em>,
which may be taken as from <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>50</span></span> to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>500</span></span> second for aerial work,
(2) <em>good efficiency</em>, which has already been treated, and
(3) <em>uniformity of speed</em> during its travel across the plate.
Before the advent of aerial photography little attention
was paid to speed uniformity, differences of 50 per cent. in
initial and final speed being common in focal-plane shutters,
and but little noticed in ordinary landscape work because
of the natural variation of brightness from sky to ground.
In the making of aerial mosaic maps the non-uniformity of
density across the plate results in a most offensive series of
abrupt changes of tone at the junction points of the successive
prints (Fig. <a href='#fig_140'>140</a>), an effect which must be minimized
by manipulation of the printing light.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instruments for testing the speed and uniformity of
action of focal-plane shutters are an essential part of any
laboratory for developing or testing photographic apparatus
and some simple device for setting and checking shutter
speed should be available in the field. Every such speed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>tester must contain some form of time counting element—pendulum,
tuning fork or clock-work. Elaborate shutter
testers, suitable for determining all the characteristics of
all types of shutter, have been developed and used in certain
of the photographic research laboratories. For the study and
setting of focal-plane shutters (whose efficiency need not be
measured, as it can be simply calculated from linear dimensions),
the following simple kinds of apparatus are adequate:</p>

<div id='fig_023'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/fig_023.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 23.</span>—Apparatus for testing focal plane shutter speed throughout the travel of the curtain.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Clock dial type of shutter tester.</em> This consists essentially
of a black clock dial carrying a white pointer which makes
its complete revolution in one second or less. If this dial
is photographed by the camera under test, the width of the
sector traced during the exposure by the moving pointer
shows the time interval. If the dial is photographed at
several points on the plate—beginning, middle and end of
the shutter travel—the complete characteristics of the
shutter can be determined.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Interrupted light type of shutter tester.</em> For the study of
uniformity of shutter action alone the apparatus shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig_023'>23</a> may be employed. <em>A</em> is a high intensity light source,
such as an arc or a gas filled tungsten lamp. <em>L</em> is a convex
lens, focussing an image of the light source on a small aperture
in the screen <em>E</em>. <em>D</em> is a sector disc which, driven by the
motor <em>M</em>, interrupts the transmitted light with a frequency
determined by the number of openings of the sector and by
the speed of rotation, which must be measured by a tachometer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The light diverging from the aperture in <em>E</em> falls
upon the shutter <em>S</em>, which for this test is reduced to a narrow
slit of one millimeter or less. Passing through the shutter
opening the light falls upon the photographic plate <em>P</em>.
The principle is simple: If the light is uninterrupted, the
plate <em>P</em> is exposed at all points; due to the interruptions, a
series of parallel lines of photographic action result, and
their distance apart gives a measure of the speed of the
shutter at any chosen point in its travel. A performance
curve of the French Klopcic shutter is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_024'>24</a>.
The variation in speed lies over a range of two to one. So
serious is this defect in these shutters that diaframs are
sometimes inserted in the French cameras to cut off part of
the light from the lens on the most exposed end of the plate.
This expedient produces uniformity of photographic action,
but does not overcome the movement of the image, which is
one of the chief faults of excessive exposure.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 25.</span>—Optical system of shutter tester for Air Service, U. S. Army.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A more complete apparatus, adapted both to absolute
speed determinations and to the study of uniformity of
action, is that worked out and used in the United States
Air Service (Fig. <a href='#fig_025'>25</a>). At <em>A</em> is a high intensity light source,
an image of which is focussed by the lens <em>L</em><sub>1</sub> upon a slit <em>E</em>,
in front of which stands a tuning fork <em>T</em>, of period 1024
or 2048 per second. The light diverging from the slit is
received by a second lens, <em>L</em><sub>2</sub> which is arranged either to focus
the slit image upon the shutter curtain or to render the rays
parallel, so that an entire camera may be inserted. In the
latter case the camera lens <em>L</em><sub>3</sub> serves to focus the slit image
on the curtain <em>C</em>. After passing through the curtain aperture
the light is focussed by the lens <em>L</em><sub>4</sub> on the rotatable drum <em>D</em>,
which carries a strip of sensitive film.</p>

<p class='c000'>The operation of testing a shutter consists in focussing
the slit image on the portion of the shutter whose performance
is required, striking the tuning fork to set it vibrating,
rotating the drum rapidly and setting off the shutter.
There is thus obtained on the sensitive film an exposed strip
resembling in appearance the edge of a saw, the number of
teeth showing the time interval in vibrations of the tuning
fork. Three exposures usually give all the points necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>for a practical knowledge of the shutter's uniformity of
action. A point of some importance, learned from numerous
shutter tests, is that a focal-plane shutter should be tested
in the position in which it is to be used. Aerial camera
shutters should be tested in the horizontal position.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Types of Focal-plane Shutters.</strong>—A variety of means
have been utilized for securing the necessary variation in
speed in focal-plane shutters. Their success is to be measured
by the actual speed range and by the uniformity of
speed attained. In aerial cameras at present in use we find
<em>variable tension</em> of the curtain spring, the aperture being
fixed; <em>variable opening</em> with fixed tension; <em>multiple curtain
openings</em> with fixed spring tension; and combinations of two
or all of these methods of speed control. The problem of
covering the aperture during the operation of winding up or
setting the shutter has led to further elaborations of shutter
mechanism. These take the form of <em>lens or shutter flaps</em>, <em>auxiliary
curtains</em>, and shutters of the <em>self-capping</em> type. Shutters
embodying all these features are briefly described below.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Representative Shutters.</strong>—The Folmer variable tension
shutter is used on the United States Air Service hand-held
and hand-operated plate camera and on some of the film
cameras. It consists of a fixed aperture curtain wound on
a curtain roller in which the spring can be set to various
tensions, numbered 1 to 10. The range of speeds attainable
is at best about three to one, or from <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>300</span></span> second,
considerably shorter than the range indicated as desirable.
Its uniformity of travel is variable with the tension, as shown
by representative performance curves in Fig. <a href='#fig_030'>30</a>. Lacking
any self-capping feature the shutter is provided either with
an auxiliary curtain, or in the hand-held camera with flaps
in front of the lens, opened by the exposing lever before the
curtain is released (Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>). This shutter is made a removable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>unit in the 18 × 24 centimeter hand-operated camera,
but is built into the hand-held and film cameras.</p>

<div id='fig_026'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 26.</span>—Removable four-slit shutter of German (Ica) camera, showing flaps.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>The Ica shutter</em> used on the standard German aerial
cameras is a good example of the multiple slit curtain
(Fig. <a href='#fig_026'>26</a>). Four fixed aperture slits are provided, with a single
tension, the openings roughly in the ratio 1, ½, ¼, ⅛, which
when the spring tension is properly adjusted give exposures
of <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>90</span></span>, <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>180</span></span>, <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>375</span></span>, <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>750</span></span> second. To pass from one exposure
time to another the setting milled head is wound up to successively
higher steps or else exposed one or more times
without resetting, depending on the direction it is desired
to go. Capping during setting, or during exposure, in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>to change the opening, is provided for by a pair of flaps on
the shutter unit, which open into the camera body. The
mechanical work on these shutters is of excellent quality,
the curtain running with exceptional smoothness. Provision
is made for adjusting the tension until the marked speeds
are attained; this is presumably done in a repair laboratory
to which the shutter only need be sent, as it is a removable
unit. Tests made on one of these shutters wound to its
highest tension are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_030'>30</a>. The marked speeds
are not attained, and there is considerable lack of uniformity
from start to finish of the travel.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>L camera variable-aperture shutter.</em> The shutter of the L
type camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_027'>27</a>) is representative of one of the most
primitive methods of varying aperture. The two jaws of
the slit are held together by a long cord passing completely
around the aperture, fastened permanently at one end and
attached at its other end by a sliding clasp or saddle. As
this saddle is forced in one direction the slit is closed, in the
opposite direction the cord becomes slack, and after the shutter
is released once or twice the slit assumes a wider opening.
A chronic trouble is the breaking of the cords. Its opening
can be changed only after the plate magazine is removed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>U. S. Air Service variable-aperture shutter.</em> This shutter
is incorporated in the American deRam and in other late
American cameras (Fig. <a href='#fig_028'>28</a>). Its characteristic feature is
the introduction of an idler, whose distance from the main
curtain roller can be varied. Tapes whereby the following
curtain is attached to the spring roller pass over this idler,
and by changing its position the aperture or distance between
the two curtain elements is altered over a large range.
Tests of this shutter are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_030'>30</a>. A speed of <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>50</span></span>
second is provided for by a slit width of five centimeters,
and the highest speed is fixed only by the practical limit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>approach of the jaws. Experiment shows great uniformity
of rate of travel to be attainable by combining careful choice
of spring length and tension with good workmanship in the
mechanical features. Variable-aperture fixed-tension shutters
have a definite advantage over the variable-tension
type in that they can utilize for all speeds that tension which
gives uniform action. The capping feature of this shutter is
provided in the American deRam by flaps, in the automatic
film camera by an auxiliary curtain. The shutter is removable
in the deRam, but built into the other camera.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><em>The Klopcic</em> variable-tension, variable-aperture, self-capping
shutter is an example of an attempt to meet all
shutter requirements with an entirely self-contained mechanism.
It is shown diagrammatically in Fig. <a href='#fig_029'>29</a>. Tapes
<em>G</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>G</em><sub>2</sub> are used to connect the following curtain <em>B</em>
directly to the spring roller <em>T</em>, at a fixed distance, while the
leading curtain, <em>A</em>, may be slid along the tapes by small friction
buckles, <em>C</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>C</em><sub>2</sub>, auxiliary springs <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>R</em><sub>2</sub> serving to keep
it taut in any position. When the shutter is being set the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>buckles are arrested against stops while the winding-up
continues for what is to be the following half of the curtain
in exposing. When released the curtain moves across
with an aperture fixed by the point of setting of the buckle
stops. At the end of the travel the buckles are arrested by
other stops, while the following portion of the curtain continues
its travel to the end. On re-winding, therefore, the
aperture is closed. Variable tension as well as variable
aperture is provided, although little used. In the French
cameras a lens flap is also inserted behind the lens, but this
is not needed if the self-capping feature functions properly.
On the hand cameras this flap is said to be necessary in
order to prevent a curious kind of accident: if the camera
is held on the knee, pointing upward, an image of the sun
may be formed on the curtain and burn a hole through it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The performance of the French shutter in respect to
uniformity has already been shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_024'>24</a>. It leaves
very much to be desired. Besides non-uniformity of action
during its travel it exhibits another common defect of
variable-tension shutters, namely, the curtain must be released
several times after a change of tension before the new
speed is established (Fig. <a href='#fig_030'>30</a>, tensions 5 and 5´).</p>

<p class='c000'>The French shutter as made for the deMaria cameras
is a removable unit. The small size (13 × 18 cm.) sets by
the straight pull of a projecting pin, the larger (18 × 24 cm.)
by winding up a milled head. The former is the more convenient
motion for an aerial camera. Care must be taken
with either type that the motion of setting is not stopped
when the first resistance is encountered; this occurs when
the tape buckles strike their stop and the slit begins to open.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>PLATE-HOLDERS AND MAGAZINES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the earlier days of airplane photography the ordinary
plate-holder or double dark slide was used to some extent,
but it is ill-suited to the purpose because of the considerable
time and attention required for its operation. It has nevertheless
the merit of adding little to the length of the camera,
and it works in any position. For these reasons it has remained
in occasional use for the taking of oblique views
with long focus cameras in a cramped fuselage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next in order of progress rank the simple box magazines,
for holding a dozen, eighteen or twenty-four plates, as used
in the English C, E, and L type cameras. These are little
more than boxes with sliding lids which when open permit
the introduction or removal of the plates. Figs. <a href='#fig_045'>45</a> and <a href='#fig_046'>46</a>
illustrate the magazine of this type as made for the English
C and E cameras. It is constructed of wood, grooved to fit
tracks on the camera, and is furnished with a sliding door or
lid hinged in the middle to fold down out of the way when
open. The eighteen plates are carried in metal sheaths,
both to provide opaque screens between them, and to protect
them from injury in the mechanism of the camera. Fig. <a href='#fig_027'>27</a>
shows the all-metal magazine made for the American model
L camera. This differs from the English in material of construction,
plate capacity (24 instead of 18) and manner of
operating the slide, which is built up of three thicknesses of
phosphor bronze and draws out through metal guides bent
into semicircular form. A snap catch holds this slide at
either end of its travel. The leather strap introduced in the
American model for carrying and handling is a distinct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>improvement. These magazines contain no springs or other
mechanism, as the cameras with which they are used depend
upon the action of gravity for emptying the upper (feeding)
magazine, and filling the lower (receiving) one.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 31.</span>—Aerial hand camera (U. S. type A-2).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Next in order of complexity may be ranked the <em>bag
magazine</em> (Figs. <a href='#fig_031'>31</a> and <a href='#fig_044'>44</a>). In this the exposed plate is
pulled out of the magazine proper by a metal slide or rod
into a leather bag. The rod is then pushed back, the plate
in its metal sheath is grasped through the leather bag, lifted
to the back of the magazine, and forced in behind the other
plates. The number of plates exposed is indicated either by
numbers on the backs of the sheaths, visible through a red
glazed opening in the back, or else by a counter actuated
by the metal slide rod. Usually twelve are carried in a
magazine. For aerial work the common design of this
magazine as used for ground work must be modified by
providing extra large easily grasped hooks both on the draw
rod and on the dark slide, which must be drawn before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>making the first exposure and replaced after the last. The
small rings and grips of the standard commercial magazine
are almost impossible to handle through heavy gloves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next type of magazine is represented by three
designs, the <em>Gaumont</em> and <em>deMaria</em>, used very generally by
the French during the war, and the <em>Ernemann</em>, used almost
universally in the German air service (Figs. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>, <a href='#fig_040'>40</a> and <a href='#fig_042'>42</a>).
In all of these the operation of plate changing is the same:
the end of the magazine is pulled out and thrust back, a more
simple operation than the bag manipulation just described.
The internal workings are different according to size. In
the smaller French magazines (13 × 18 cm.) the camera is
first pointed upward, all the plates are drawn out except
the one to be changed, and this, with the aid of springs, drops
to the bottom, after which the other plates push back over
it. The plates pull out in the direction of their long dimension.
In the larger French magazine (18 × 24 cm.) only the
exposed plate pulls out. The pull is in the direction of the
shorter dimension of the plate, which is lifted up by heavy
springs and slides back over the top of the pile. In the
Ernemann magazine only six plates are carried, which there
is good reason to believe represent the maximum feasible
number, judging by the reports of jambs and breakages in
the twelve-plate French magazines. In all of these magazines
laminated wood slides pull out and in at each operation,
and while satisfactory if made and operated in one climate,
experience indicates that if made in America and sent abroad
swelling of the wood may be expected to prevent their
successful operation.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Alternative forms of magazine, somewhat more practical
from the standpoint of manufacture and export, are several
designs embodying <em>two compartments</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>). In the most
simple of these the plates are moved, immediately before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>or after exposing, from the unexposed to the exposed side.
Illustrative of this type are the Folmer designs, in which the
to-and-fro motion is imparted by a rack geared to a pinion
actuated either by a lever, in the hand camera, or by the
power drive, in the automatic design (Figs. <a href='#fig_033'>33</a> and <a href='#fig_053'>53</a>). Another
illustration is afforded by the Piserini and Mondini
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>magazine, in which the operation of changing is performed
by a back-and-forth motion of a hand-grip, which also sets
the camera shutter (Fig. <a href='#fig_047'>47</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>In these magazines the center of gravity changes as the
exposed plates are moved over, and only half the inside
space is occupied with plates. These objections are overcome
in the Chassel form, where both compartments are
always full. Transfer of the bottom exposed plate from one
compartment to the other is compensated for by the simultaneous
shift of the top plate in the receiving compartment,
to the feeding side. In a modification of this idea by Ruttan
the exposing position is when the plates are half-way through
the shifting process, whereby the magazine may be symmetrically
mounted on the camera body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other more complicated magazines have been designed,
some of which are shown in the diagrammatic <em>ensembles</em> of
Figs. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a> and <a href='#fig_048'>48</a>. In the Jacquelin, the main body of plates
is raised while the bottom (exposed) plate is folded against
the side. The main body of plates then drops back to place,
the exposed plate is carried on upward and folds down on
the back of the pile. The Bellieni magazine system uses
three, a central feeding one and two below for receiving,
one on each side of the camera body. These were made
solely for attachment to captured German cameras. In
the Fournieux magazine the plates are carried in an interior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>rotating box. The plate to be exposed is dropped off the
front of the pile, down to the focal plane, and after exposure
is picked up and placed at the back of the pile, which has
turned over in the meanwhile. The deRam rotating magazine
is described in connection with the camera of which it
is an essential part (Fig. <a href='#fig_052'>52</a>).</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 36.</span>—Training plane equipped for photography, showing “L” camera in floor mount and magazine rack forward of the observer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For the protection of the plates during their manipulation,
and in the camera, all plate magazines thus far developed
carry them in thin <em>metal sheaths</em>. These add greatly both
to the weight and to the time necessary to handle the plates,
but no means have as yet been found for dispensing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>them. Fig. <a href='#fig_035'>35</a> shows a representative sheath or septum, as
used in the L camera. On three sides the edge is bent up
and turned over, forming a ledge for the plate to press
against. The fourth side is left open for inserting the plate,
which is then held in by a small upward projecting lip, and
kept close against the ledges by narrow springs at the sides.
To insert or remove the plate the projecting lip is depressed,
either by springing the sheath by pressure from the sides
or by using an appropriate tool.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Care of sheaths.</em> Unless systematically taken care of,
plate sheaths become bent or dented. They are then a
menace to camera operation, catching or jamming in the
plate changing process, breaking plates and damaging
camera mechanisms. In order to maintain them flat and
true, steel forms are necessary on which the sheaths may be
hammered to shape with a mallet (Fig. <a href='#fig_035'>35</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Magazine racks.</em> Reconnaissance and mapping call for
a number of exposures much greater than the capacity of
one 12, 18, or 24 plate magazine. Additional magazines
must therefore be carried. These should be in racks convenient
to the observer (Fig. <a href='#fig_036'>36</a>), securely held yet capable
of quick removal and insertion. In the rack designed to
carry two of the metal magazines for the American L Camera,
the magazines slide into loose grooves formed by a metal lip.
They are prevented from slipping out by a spring catch,
past which they slide when inserted but which is instantly
thrown aside by pressure of the thumb as the hand grasps
the magazine handle for removal.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>HAND-HELD CAMERAS FOR AERIAL WORK</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Field of Use.</strong>—The first cameras to be used for aerial
photography were hand-held ones of ordinary commercial
types. Indeed the idea is still prevalent that to obtain
aerial photographs the aviator merely leans over the side
with the folding pocket camera of the department store
show window and presses the button. But the Great War
had not lasted long before the ordinary bellows focussing
hand camera was replaced by the rigid-body fixed-focus
form, equipped with handles or pistol grip for better holding
in the high wind made by the plane's progress through the
air. Even this phase of aerial photography was comparatively
short-lived. The need for cameras of great focal
length, and the need for apparatus demanding the minimum
of the pilot's or observer's attention, both tended to relegate
hand-held cameras to second place, so that they were comparatively
little used in the later periods of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet for certain purposes they have great value. They
can be used in any plane for taking oblique views, and for
taking verticals, in any plane in which an opening for unobstructed
view can be made in the floor of the observer's
cockpit. They can be quickly pointed in any desired
direction, thus reducing to a minimum the necessary maneuvering
of the plane, a real advantage when under attack
by “Archies” or in working under adverse weather conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>For peace-time mapping work the hand-held camera,
when equipped with spirit-levels on top, and when worked
by a skilful operator, possesses some advantages over anything
short of an automatically stabilized camera. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>experimental testing of plates, filters and various accessories,
the ready accessibility of all its parts makes the hand-held
camera the easiest and most satisfactory of instruments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The limitations of the hand-held camera lie in its necessary
restriction to small plate sizes and short focal lengths, and
in the fact that it must occupy the entire attention of the
observer while pictures are being taken—the latter a serious
objection only in war-time.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Essential Characteristics.</strong>—In addition to the general
requirements as to lens, shutter and magazine, common to
all aerial cameras, the hand camera must meet the special
problems introduced by holding in the hands, especially over
the top of the plane's cockpit. An exceptionally good system
of handles or grips must be provided whereby the camera
can be pointed when pictures are taken, and held while
plates are being changed and the shutter set. The weight
and balance of the camera must be correct within narrow
limits; the wind resistance must be as small as possible; the
shutter release must be arranged so as to give no jerk or tilt
to the camera in exposing.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the method of holding the camera, a favorite at
first among military men was the pistol grip, with a trigger
shutter release (Fig. <a href='#fig_037'>37</a>). Because of the size and weight
of the camera the pistol grip alone was an inadequate means
of support and additional handles on the side or bottom had
to be provided for the left hand. Small (8 × 12 cm.) pistol
grip cameras were used to some extent by the Germans
(Fig. <a href='#fig_042'>42</a>), and a number of 4 × 5 inch experimental cameras
of this type were built for the American Air Service (Fig. <a href='#fig_037'>37</a>).
But the grasp obtained with such a design is not so good as is
obtained with handles on each side or with flat straps to go
over the hands. The camera balances best with the handles
in the plane of the center of gravity. As to weight, no set
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>rules are laid down, but experience has shown that a fairly
heavy camera—as heavy as is convenient to handle—will
hold steadier than a light one. The American 4 × 5 inch
cameras described below weigh with their magazines in the
neighborhood of twelve pounds.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Representative Types of Hand-held Cameras.</strong>—French
and German hand-held cameras are essentially smaller
editions of their standard long-focus cameras, and a description
of them will apply to a considerable extent to the large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>cameras to be discussed in a later chapter. The English and
American hand-held cameras are generally quite different in
type from the large ones, which are used attached to the plane.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 38.</span>—Diagram of French (deMaria) 26 cm. focus hand camera, using 13 × 18 cm. plates.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>The French hand-held camera</em> uses 13 × 18 centimeter
plates, carried in a deMaria magazine, and has a lens of 26
centimeters focus. The shutter is the Klopcic self-capping
type already described, and is removable. The camera body,
built of sheet aluminum, takes a pyramidal shape. In Fig.
<a href='#fig_038'>38</a>, <em>A</em> is the shutter release and <em>B</em> the rectangular sight, of
which <em>C</em> is the rear or eye sight. The complete sight may be
placed either on the top or on the bottom of the camera.
At <em>D</em> are the handles, sloping forward from top to bottom;
<em>E</em> is a catch for holding the magazine; <em>F</em> is a door for reaching
the back of the lens and the lens flap; <em>G</em> is a snap clasp for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>holding the front door of the camera closed; <em>H</em> is a ring for
attaching a strap to go around the observer's neck; <em>I</em> is the
lever which opens the flap behind the lens and releases the
focal-plane shutter; <em>J</em> is a snap catch for holding the front
door of the camera open.</p>

<p class='c000'>The operations with this camera are three in number.
Starting immediately after the exposure, the camera is
pointed lens upward and the plate changed by pulling the
inner body of the magazine out and then in; next the shutter
is set; then the camera is pointed, and finally exposed by a
gentle pull on the exposing lever.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The English hand-held camera</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_186'>186</a>). This differs
from the French in the size of plate (4 × 5 inch), in the shape
of the camera body, which is circular, and in the type of
shutter, which is fixed-tension variable-opening. In the
longer focus camera (10 to 12 inch) the shutter is self-capping,
and the aperture is controlled by a thumb-screw at the side.
In the smaller (6 inch) a lens flap is provided in front of the
lens and the shutter aperture is varied by a sliding saddle
and cord. The handles of the camera are placed vertical,
instead of sloping as in the French. The shutter is released
by a thumb-actuated lever. Double dark slides are used, as
the multiple plate magazine has not found favor in the
English service.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The German hand-held camera</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_042'>42</a>). The German
hand-held camera is, like their whole series, built of canvas-covered
wood, the body having an octagonal cross-section.
It is equipped with the Ica shutter and uses the Ernemann
six plate (13 × 18 cm.) magazine. The excellent system of
grips by which the camera is held and pointed is an especially
commendable feature. On the right-hand side is a handle
similar to the French type, but carefully shaped to fit the
hand. The left-hand grip consists of a long, rounded block of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>wood running diagonally from top to bottom of the side,
with a deep groove on the forward side for the finger tips,
while over the hand is stretched a leather strap, the whole
aim being to provide an absolutely sure and comfortable
hold on the camera during the plate changing and shutter
setting operations.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>United States Air Service hand cameras.</em> The hand camera
developed for the United States Air Service and manufactured
by the Eastman Kodak Co. is made in three models,
using the bag magazine, a two-compartment magazine, and
roll film, respectively. The shutter is of the fixed (one or two)
aperture variable tension type, built into the camera. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>distinctive feature is the double lens flap, in front of the lens
actuated by the thumb pressure shutter release (Fig. <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>).
In the bag magazine camera the shutter is set, as a separate
operation, by a wing handle, and a similar handle controls
the tension adjustment. In the two-compartment type
(Fig. <a href='#fig_033'>33</a>) the shutter wind-up is geared to the plate changing
lever, so that but one operation is necessary to prepare the
camera for exposure. In the film type (Fig. <a href='#fig_034'>34</a>) a single lever
motion sets the shutter and winds up the film ready for
the next exposure. After the last exposure of all the film is
wound backward on its own (feeding) roller before removing
from the camera. The film is held flat by a closely fitting
metal plate behind, and by guides at the edges in front,
an arrangement which with small sizes works fairly well
although the exquisite sharpness of focus attainable with
plates is not to be expected. The saving in weight made
possible by the use of film in place of plates in metal
sheaths is about three pounds per dozen exposures.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all these cameras the sight—a tube with front and back
cross wires—is placed at the bottom. This position has been
found the most convenient for airplane work, as it necessitates
the observer raising himself but little above the cockpit,
a matter of prime importance when the tremendous
drive of the wind is taken into account.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>NON-AUTOMATIC AERIAL PLATE CAMERAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The ideal of every military photographic service has been
an automatic or at least a semi-automatic camera, in order
to reduce the observer's work to a minimum. Yet as a
matter of fact almost all the aerial photography of the Great
War was done with entirely hand-operated cameras. The
primary reason for this was that no entirely satisfactory
automatic cameras were developed, cameras at once simple
to install and reliable when operated. Even the propeller-drive
semi-automatic L type of the British Air Service was
very commonly operated by hand, for many of the pilots
and observers regarded the propeller merely as another part
to go wrong.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any automatic mechanism in the airplane must work
well in spite of vibration, three dimensional movements,
and great range of temperature. The requirements were
well recognized when the war closed, but had not yet been
met. Careful study of the conditions and needs by competent
designers of automatic machinery may be expected to
result at an early date in reliable cameras of the automatic
type, but the description below of hand-operated cameras
really covers practically all the cameras found satisfactory
in actual warfare.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>General Characteristics of Hand-operated Cameras.</strong>—As
distinguished from the hand-held cameras the larger
hand-operated cameras are characterized by the greater
focal length of their lenses, the size of plate employed, and
the manner of holding—by some form of anti-vibration
mounting attached directly to the fuselage.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Except for the early English C and E type cameras which
called for 10 inch lenses and 4 × 5 inch plates, the general
practice at the close of the war by agreement between the
French, English and American Air Services, was for the use
of 18 × 24 centimeter plates and for lenses with focal lengths
of approximately 25, 50 and 120 centimeters. The English
also made use of a 14 inch (35 centimeter) lens, and never
made a regular practice of anything larger than 50 centimeters.
The Germans and Italians restricted themselves
to the 13 × 18 centimeter size of plate, while a lens of 70
centimeters focal length was standardized with the Germans,
in addition to the 25, 50, and 120 centimeter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The particular focal length was determined by the nature
of the photographic mission. Where large areas were to be
covered at low altitudes or without the demand for exquisite
detail, the shorter focus lenses suffice. The most commonly
used lens in the French Service was the 50 centimeter, while
the 120 was employed when high flying was necessary or
when minute detail was required. As already mentioned,
the common practice was to keep cameras of all focal lengths
available, but the ideal at the close of the war was to have
the camera nose and lens a detachable unit, so that any focal
length desired could be secured with the same camera body.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The standard French camera.</em> The hand-held form of
French camera has already been described. The cameras
for larger plate sizes and longer focus lenses differ only in
the addition of a Bowden-wire distance release for the
shutter and in the use of the Gaumont magazine which
operates without the necessity of pointing the exposed side
of the magazine upward. Fig. <a href='#fig_040'>40</a> illustrates the 50 centimeter
camera, and Fig. <a href='#fig_041'>41</a> the 120.</p>

larger cameras carries a distinctive feature in the distance
control of the lens diafram, worked by means of a lever
which actuates racks, pinions and connecting rods leading
to the lens. On the side of the camera body a shallow box
is provided for carrying the color filter in its bayonet joint
mount to fit on the lens (Figs. <a href='#fig_042'>42</a> and <a href='#fig_043'>43</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The hand-operated bag-magazine camera</em> of the United
States Air Service (Type M) is similar to the small hand-held
camera, but differs in three respects: a removable
shutter (of the variable-tension fixed-aperture type) embodying
an auxiliary curtain for capping during the setting operation;
a Bowden-wire shutter release; and the employment
of a set of standard interchangeable cones to hold lenses of
several focal lengths. The 20 inch and 10 inch cones are
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_044'>44</a>. The operation of this camera is similar
to the French standard cameras, but not so simple because of
the number of motions required in manipulating the bag.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>Its chief objection for war work lies in fact in the magazine,
which should be superseded by a two-compartment or other
satisfactory type of plate changing chamber. The camera
alone, with 20 inch cone, weighs approximately 40 pounds; the
loaded magazine, with its plates in metal sheaths, 15 pounds.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>The English C and E type cameras.</em> The C and E type
cameras have now chiefly an historic interest. They were
the first used in the English service, fixed to the fuselage,
and were later used in training work in England and in the
United States. They were never built for plates larger than
4 × 5 inch nor for lenses of more than 12 inch focus, a limitation
set by the lenses available at the time of their design.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 46.</span>—English type “E” hand-operated plate camera.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In several respects the mode of operation of the two
types is the same. The unexposed plates are held in a magazine
lying above the camera, in the axis of the lens (Fig. <a href='#fig_032'>32</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>After exposure the bottom plate is carried to one side and
allowed to fall by the action of gravity into the receiving
magazine. In the C type (Fig. <a href='#fig_045'>45</a>) an opaque slide is drawn
between the lens and the (variable-opening) shutter during
the setting operation. During the exposure period this slide
projects into a compartment on the opposite side of the
camera from the receiving magazine, thus making the
camera mechanism three plates wide. In the E type (Fig.
<a href='#fig_046'>46</a>), a flap over the lens makes it possible to dispense with
the sliding screen, and reduces the camera to about the
width of two plates. In the C type the plates are changed
by a handle on top of the camera; in the E type provision
is made for distance control by cords, and for shutter release
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>by a Bowden wire. In both cameras the operation of plate
changing also sets the shutter, a definite advance over the
two preparatory motions in the French apparatus. The C
type was constructed of wood, the E of metal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Italian two-compartment magazine camera.</em> A camera
designed by Piserini and Mondini was used to some extent
by the Italian service toward the close of the war (Fig. <a href='#fig_047'>47</a>).
This has the desirable feature just noted in the C and E
cameras: the operations of plate changing and shutter
setting are performed in a single motion. Unlike those
cameras, however, the plates are changed from one compartment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>to another of the magazine already described, without
dependence on gravity, by an entirely positive shifting
action. The setting of the self-capping focal-plane shutter
is accomplished by a projecting finger engaging the shutter
mechanism. Cameras of this general type, built for 18 by
24 centimeter plates, with interchangeable lens cones,
removable shutters, and preferably magazines in which the
center of gravity does not shift as the plates are changed,
represent the next step in advance of the French practice,
and may indeed prove all that is necessary or desirable in
camera complexity for peace-time photography from the air.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The standard Italian camera and similar types.</em> The
camera (Lamperti) which the Italian Air Service used
almost exclusively during the war exemplifies a type quite
different from anything as yet described (Figs. <a href='#fig_048'>48</a> and <a href='#fig_049'>49</a>).
Plates to the number of twenty-four (13 × 18 cm.) are loaded
into a chamber at the top of the camera. Each plate is held
in a septum furnished with projecting lugs at one end. A
lever acting through a Bowden wire, exposes the bottom
plate, which then swings downward about these lugs as
pivots, and is forced by a pair of fingers into a compartment
at the side. The between-the-lens shutter has a single speed
of <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>150</span></span> second, and variation of exposure is achieved by
altering the lens aperture.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great advantage of this camera is its simplicity, a
single motion performing all the operations. Its disadvantages
are its dependence on gravity for operation, its between-the-lens
shutter, the limitation set to the number of
exposures, and the necessity for removing the whole camera
to take out the plates for developing. In actual practice
the camera has worked out well. The better light found in
the Italian as contrasted with the northern theatre of war
makes the between-the-lens shutter at high speed adequate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>while the limitation to the number of exposures has been
met by carrying several complete cameras in each plane.
Because of the Bowden-wire operation these cameras need
not be accessible to the observer or pilot, so that the practice
of carrying them in single-seaters was common. Attempts
at standardization of Allied practice through the adoption
of standard lens cones were, of course, out of the question
with this camera. With its limitations of shutter efficiency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and plate size it is doubtful whether it would have been
satisfactory outside the service for which it was developed.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The limitations set by the between-the-lens shutter in
this type have been overcome in an experimental camera
along similar lines made by the Premo Works of the Eastman
Kodak Company, and in the French Aubry model (Fig. <a href='#fig_048'>48</a>).
These employ focal-plane shutters which swing out of the
way and are set as the exposed plate swings or drops to the
receiving chamber. The dependence on gravity in this type
could doubtless be avoided by positive finger mechanisms.
If so, the resultant cameras, set and exposed by a single
motion, would acquire a highly desirable simplicity of operation.
They would have peculiar merit because of the very
short interval required between exposures—a characteristic
needed for making low stereo-oblique views. The cameras
just mentioned have, however, departed far in form from the
lines of standardized practice and have not been followed up.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>In the hand-operated camera the limit to progress is set
when the number of operations is reduced to a minimum.
In cameras using the larger sizes of plates a reduction in the
number of operations almost inevitably results in inflicting
considerable muscular labor upon the operator. Furthermore,
distance operation becomes difficult to arrange for, because
the common reliance—the Bowden wire—is unfitted for
heavy loads. Consequently, for setting the shutter and
changing the plates we must resort to some other source of
power than the observer's arm. Air-driven turbines or
propellers have been used on aerial cameras, as well as clock-work,
and also electric power, the latter derived either from
a generator or from storage batteries. The relative merits
of these sources of power form the subject of a separate
chapter. Mention only is here made of the form of drive
actually employed in connection with the various cameras.</p>

<p class='c000'>The term <em>semi-automatic camera</em> is best used to designate
that type in which the observer (or pilot) has merely to
release the shutter, after which the mechanism performs all
the operations necessary to prepare for the next exposure.
There has been some difference of opinion as to whether it
is ever advisable to go further than this with plate cameras.
The English Service holds that completely automatic exposing,
in addition to plate changing, is apt to encourage the
making of many more pictures than necessary, involving
carrying an excessive weight of plates. The French Service
has rather generally favored entirely automatic cameras in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>theory, although during the war practically all the work
of the French army was done by the hand-operated cameras
already described.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The English L Type Camera.</strong>—The L, a modification of
the earlier C and E models, differs from its predecessors
chiefly in the addition of a mechanism which when connected
with a suitable source of power can be used whenever desired
for changing the plates and setting the shutter. As in the
C and E types, all unexposed plates are carried in a magazine
above the camera, while the exposed plates are shifted in a
horizontal direction to one side and fall thence to a receiving
magazine.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 51.</span>—Mechanism of “L” camera.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Fig. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a> shows the American model, which is a copy,
with modifications, of the original English design. Its weight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>with one loaded magazine is about 35 pounds. Its manner
of functioning may be studied from the picture of the
mechanism (Fig. <a href='#fig_051'>51</a>). The part of the mechanism to the
left is inoperative during hand operation, and the large
toothed wheel is locked by the removable pin shown hanging
on its chain in Fig. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a>. To change a plate and set the shutter
the projecting lever (Fig. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a>) is thrown over and back.
This causes a sliding tray, in which the exposed plate rests,
to travel to the right, over the receiving magazine, where
the plate is dropped. After this the tray returns to the left
exposing position. Simultaneously the shutter is wound up.
Exposure is made either by pressing down upon the plunger,
or better, by using a Bowden wire. Provision for both
methods of exposing, one for the pilot and one for the observer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_081'>81</a>. The shutter is the variable-aperture
type already described, provided in addition with
a tension adjustment on the back of the camera. A flap
behind the lens does the capping during the setting operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>For power operation the camera is connected through a
flexible shaft with a wind driven propeller (Figs. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a>, <a href='#fig_083'>83</a> and
<a href='#fig_084'>84</a>). The locking pin is now moved over from the toothed
wheel to the lever arm, so that the rotation of the worm
driving the large toothed wheel forces the lever through its
plate changing motion. To prevent repetition, a part of the
periphery of the toothed wheel is cut out, so that it stops when
its cycle is run. When the Bowden wire actuates the shutter
release it forces the toothed wheel around into engagement
(aided by one spring tooth) and so starts the cycle once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>When connected with the air propeller the worm is rotated
continuously. Other sources of power—an electric
motor, for instance—can be attached through the same kind
of flexible shaft. If an electric motor is employed it may be
run continuously or it may be operated with an insulated
sector introduced into the large toothed wheel so that the
electric circuit is broken and the motor stops until the wheel
is once more forced around by the exposing lever.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Faults of the L camera.</em> The L camera was the mainstay
of the English Air Service. In fact for the last two years of
the war it was practically the only camera the English used,
and they thought highly of it. It is, of course, subject to the
limitation of small plate size and short focus lens. It is in
many ways an inconvenient camera to handle. For instance,
the upper magazine cannot be closed or removed until all
the plates are passed through. Its dependence upon gravity
for the plate changing operation is a fundamental weakness,
responsible for its frequent tendency to jam in the air.
Experience made the English observers very expert in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>relieving these jams. Sometimes they would turn the
propeller backward (mounting it in an accessible position
to provide for this contingency), sometimes they would
shake or thump the camera. But while these makeshifts
would serve to secure pictures—the chief object, of course, of
the photographic service—they can scarcely be said to render
the camera satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, the propeller drive has not been universally
approved, as it furnishes an additional mechanism to make
trouble. Since it is not feasible to change from power to
hand operation while in the air, the camera is put out of
commission whenever the propeller or shaft is disabled.
Bowden-wire controls for both plate changing lever and
shutter release were common in the British service, which
considered the extra operation or the extra muscular exertion
unimportant when compared with the greater assurance
of reliable action.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The English LB and BM Cameras.</strong>—During the closing
months of the war an improved L type camera was constructed,
the LB. This differs from the L in a number of
detail changes, dictated by experience. The shutter is now
made removable and self-capping. Pivoted lugs are provided
to hold the exposed plate horizontal until the very
instant it drops, in an effort to prevent jams caused by
the plates piling up at an angle in the receiving magazine.
The chief addition, however, is the provision of several
interchangeable cones and cylinders, for carrying lenses of
focal lengths from 4 to 20 inches. Fig. <a href='#fig_095'>95</a> shows the LB with
20 inch lens cylinder mounted on a bell crank support in
the camera bay of an English plane.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BM camera is but a larger edition of the LB, for
18 × 24 centimeter plates. It also carries several interchangeable
lens cones.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span><strong>The American model deRam camera.</strong>—The rotary changing
box devised by Lieutenant deRam of the French army
and incorporated in his entirely automatic plate camera,
has been adapted by the American Air Service to a very
successful semi-automatic camera. Fig. <a href='#fig_052'>52</a> shows the principle
of this changing box. The pile of fifty plates, each in
its sheath, is carried in a rectangular box open at top and
bottom. The lower plate next the focal-plane shutter is
first exposed; the pile then rotates about a horizontal axis
through a complete turn. When the exposed plate arrives
in a vertical position it is allowed to drop off, by the opening
of cam actuated fingers, and lodges against the side of the
enclosing camera box proper. Still further along in the cycle
the plate is thrown off from its lodging place into a “scoop”
on the top of the rotating container and laid on the top of
the plate pile. Meanwhile the curtain of the focal-plane
shutter winds up, at the same time that it is depressed out of
the way of the revolving plate container. Although the
plate changing operation depends on gravity, it nevertheless
functions satisfactorily up to 30 degrees from the vertical.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shutter in this model is the variable-aperture fixed-tension
type, adjusted by pivoted idlers (Fig. <a href='#fig_028'>28</a>). In
the exposing position it runs within three millimeters of the
plate surface, and is therefore of high efficiency for all openings.
Capping during the operation of setting is performed
by flaps at the bottom of the camera body. Interchangeable
cones are supplied for lenses of various focal lengths.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hand operation the changing box is turned over by
means of a handle, which rotates four times for the complete
cycle (Fig. <a href='#fig_090'>90</a>). For semi-automatic operation an additional
mechanism is provided on the side of the rectangular
camera body, copied with some necessary modifications
after the L camera power drive. From the observer's standpoint
the operation of the whole camera is the same as in the
L camera, with the important exception that power operation
in no way interferes with hand operation. Indeed, the hand
can help out if the power flags or fails.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>This camera is most satisfactorily driven by a 12 volt
⅒ HP electric motor working through a flexible shaft
attached to a swivel connection at the front of the semi-automatic
drive box. A change once every four to five
seconds is possible, but greater speed is apt to throw the
changing plate too violently for safety.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief practical objection to this camera is its bulk.
Its great height makes it impractical for many planes. Its
weight of nearly a hundred pounds is a formidable load for
a plane to carry, but this is no more and probably less than
that of any other camera when taken up with the same number
of plates in magazines. The price paid for economizing in
magazine weight is that the whole camera body, excluding
the lens cone, must be carried to and from the plane for both
loading and unloading.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>AUTOMATIC AERIAL PLATE CAMERAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>General Characteristics.</strong>—The ideal in the automatic
plate camera is to provide a mechanism which will not only
change the plates and set the shutter, as does the semi-automatic,
but make the exposures as well, at regular intervals
under the control of the operator. Such a wholly automatic
camera would leave the observer entirely free for
other activities than photography and it is to meet this
tactically desirable aim that the war-time striving for automatic
cameras was due.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is obvious that the one essential difference between the
automatic and semi-automatic types lies in the self-contained
exposing mechanism with its device for the timing of the
exposures. There is no difficulty in arranging for the driving
power to trip the shutter, but it is no easy matter to design
apparatus which will space the exposures equally, and at
the same time permit of a variation of the interval. It is
indeed the crux of the problem of automatic camera design
to provide for the easy and certain variation of the interval
from the two or three seconds demanded for low stereoscopic
views to the minute or more that high altitude wide
angle mapping may permit. This problem is one intimately
bound up with the question of means of power drive and its
regulation, and will be treated in part in that connection.
It is to be noted, however, that there are in general two modes
of exposure interval regulation. One is by variation in the
speed at which the whole camera mechanism is driven. The
other is by the mere addition to a semi-automatic camera of
a time controlled release which affects in no way the speed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of the plate changing operation. In many respects the latter
is the best way to make an automatic camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the advantages of automatic cameras are great it
must not be overlooked that a camera which can only be
operated automatically is of limited usefulness. It is not
suited for “spotting” at any definite instant, as, for illustration,
at the moment of explosion of a bomb. It should, therefore,
be the aim of the automatic camera designer to so
build the apparatus that it can, at will, be used semi-automatically.
In addition, to meet the contingency of any
break-down in the source of power, the camera should be
capable of hand operation, as in the case of the American
semi-automatic deRam. In short, the automatic camera
should not be a separate and different type; it should merely
have an additional method of operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certain desirable mechanical features of all aerial cameras
have already been enumerated. Some of these may be
repeated here with the addition of others peculiar to automatic
cameras. As a general caution, mechanical motions
depending on gravity or on springs should be avoided.
Movements adversely affected by low temperatures (20 to
30 degrees below zero, Centigrade), are unsuitable. All
adjustments called for in the air must be operable by distance
controls whose parts are large, rugged, and not dependent
on sound or delicate touch for their correct setting.
The center of gravity of the camera should not change
during operation (important in connection with the problem
of suspension). The camera should work in the oblique as
well as in the vertical position. The power required for
operation must not exceed that available on the plane.
Electrical apparatus, for instance, should not demand more
than 100 watts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any devices which diminish the weight of the camera are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>particularly desirable in automatic plate cameras, because of
the large number of exposures which such cameras encourage.
For instance, if the plates could be handled without placing
them in metal sheaths we should gain a substantial reduction
in weight (the sheaths weigh nearly as much as the plates)
as well as in the time necessary for handling.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Brock Automatic Plate Camera.</strong>—This camera is
somewhat similar to the same designer's film camera, both
in shape, in size, and in its employment of a heavy spring
motor for the driving power. It uses 4 × 5 inch plates, and
carries a 10 to 12 inch lens.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plate-changing operation is unique. As shown
diagrammatically in Fig. <a href='#fig_052'>52</a>, the unexposed plates are carried
in a magazine on top of the camera, the exposed ones in a
magazine inserted in the body of the camera, directly below
the unexposed magazine. The bottom plate of the exposed
pile drops into a sliding frame and is carried along the top
of the camera to the exposing position. After exposure, the
plate is carried back and drops into the receiving magazine.
In order for the plate to fall only the proper distance at each
stage of the cycle, special plate sheaths are necessary. These
are cut away to form edge patterns which clear or engage
control fingers so as to ride or fall through the sliding frame
as required.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camera is entirely automatic in operation. Regulation
of the exposure interval is by a special form of variable
length escapement controlled through a Bowden wire, in a
manner parallel to that in the Brock film camera, described
elsewhere. These plate cameras were never produced
in quantity.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Folmer 13 × 18 Centimeter Automatic Camera.</strong>—This
camera, also never manufactured in quantity, is shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig_053'>53</a>, and a sketch of its manner of operation is included in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the <em>ensemble</em> of automatic camera diagrams (Fig. <a href='#fig_052'>52</a>). Its
most distinctive feature is perhaps the use of a two compartment
magazine. This is similar in form to the one already
described in connection with the hand-held cameras, but
larger, to hold eighteen 13 × 18 centimeter plates. The
unexposed plates are placed in one compartment, and after
exposure are shifted to the other. The transfer is effected
by the motion of a rack, which is part of the magazine and
which is driven by a toothed pinion, also part of the magazine,
which in turn engages in a toothed wheel projecting upward
from the camera body. This toothed wheel is turned first
in one direction and then in the other by an arrangement of
gears and levers driven by the source of power, which as
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_053'>53</a> is a wind turbine connected through a
flexible shaft. Operation is either automatic or semi-automatic
as desired, and the camera can be put through
its cycle by hand if necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>As with several other designs, the completion of the working
model of this camera occurred after agreements had
been reached by the Allies, as to plate size, standard lens
cones, and other features, not easily incorporated in it, thus
making manufacture inadvisable. The validity of the design
for peace-time work is, of course, not affected by this fact.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The deRam Camera.</strong>—The only completely automatic
plate camera actually produced commercially before the
end of hostilities was the French model deRam (Fig. <a href='#fig_054'>54</a>).
Its plate-changing action has already been described in
connection with the American semi-automatic model (Figs.
<a href='#fig_052'>52</a>, <a href='#fig_090'>90</a> and <a href='#fig_091'>91</a>). It differs from the American model in the
shutter, which is of the self-capping variety, carried on a
rising and falling frame; and in the exposing mechanism.
The latter embodies a clutch whose point of attachment to
a uniformly rotating disc in the camera is governed through a
Bowden wire, whereby the interval between the plate-changing
operation and the shutter release is varied. The intervals
are indicated by figures on the dial to which the observer's
end of the Bowden wire is attached. The source of
power for the camera is a constant speed propeller. Complete
semi-automatic operation is not possible, as an interval of 1
to 2 seconds elapses between the time a single exposure is
called for and its occurrence. No arrangement is provided
for hand operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be noted that while this camera is a true automatic
apparatus it does not meet even a majority of the requirements
listed above as found desirable by experience. There
exists a great opportunity for designing and developing an
entirely satisfactory automatic plate camera—provided it is
agreed that anything more than semi-automatic operation
is ever advisable for plates.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>AERIAL FILM CAMERAS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The weight of the glass and the sheaths in the plate
camera forms its most serious drawback. This weight must
be reckoned at least three quarters of a pound for each
18 × 24 centimeter plate. Consequently, with the use of these
large plates, and with the demands for ever increasing numbers
of pictures to be taken on long reconnaissance flights, a
serious conflict arises between the weight of the photographic
equipment and the carrying capacity of the plane. Among
plate cameras probably the most economical in weight is
the deRam. It carries fifty 18 × 24 centimeter plates, and
has a total weight of approximately 100 pounds. An advance
to 100 or 200 plates—not feasible in the deRam construction—even
if we assume the lightest possible magazines,
would bring the weight of camera and plates to 150 or 200
pounds, which would be detrimental to the balance and
would seriously infringe on the fuel carrying capacity and
ceiling of any ordinary reconnaissance plane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early and persistent attention was therefore paid to the
possibilities of celluloid film in rolls, as used so widely in
hand cameras and in moving picture work. The two great
advantages of film would be its practically negligible weight
(approximately one-tenth that of plates, not including
sheaths) and its small bulk, which would permit the greatest
freedom in the development of entirely automatic cameras
to make exposures by the hundreds instead of by the dozens.
Certain disadvantages were foreseen at the outset: the
difficulty of holding the film flat and immune from vibration
in the larger sizes; the difficulty of quickly developing and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>drying large rolls; the question whether as good speed or
color sensitiveness could be obtained in sensitive emulsions
when flowed on a celluloid base as on glass. Early trials
revealed a further problem to solve: how to eliminate the
discharge of static electricity occurring at high altitudes,
especially when the weather is cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>As far as camera construction is concerned the chief
problems are to hold the film flat, and to eliminate static.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Methods of Holding Film Flat.</strong>—Several means have been
proposed and used for holding the film flat. Disregarding
mere pressure guides at the side, which are suitable only for
small area films (up to 4 × 5 inch), the successful means
have taken three forms: <em>pressure of a glass plate</em>, <em>pressure
of the shutter curtain</em>, and <em>suction</em>. A glass pressure plate
can be used in either of two ways; the film may be in continuous
contact with it or may be pressed against its surface
only at the moment of exposure. The advantage of this
first method lies solely in its mechanical simplicity; its disadvantage
in the likelihood of scratches or pressure markings
on the film. Where a glass plate is used there is always the
chance of a dust or dirt film accumulating, or of the condensation
of moisture, to impair the quality of the negative.
There is, moreover, an inevitable loss of light (about 10%),
together with some slight distortion, due to the bending of
the marginal oblique rays through the thickness of the glass.
In cases where a filter would normally be employed, the loss
of light is minimized by using yellow glass for the plate, so
that it serves for filter and film holder as well.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Pressure of the shutter curtain</em> is utilized in the Duchatellier
film camera by furnishing the edges of the curtain
aperture with heavy velvet strips, whose light and gentle
pressure during the passage of the shutter holds the film
against a metal back. In many ways this is the simplest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>film-holding device; it occasions no loss of light, and needs
no mechanical movements or external accessories, such as are
called for in the suction devices next described. There is
always danger of markings on the film, if the velvet is not of
the right thickness and softness, and the operation and speed
control of the shutter are necessarily complicated by the
additional frictional load.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Suction</em> of the film against a perforated back plate has
been found a very successful means of securing flatness.
Suction at the moment of exposure may be produced by the
action of a bellows, which has been compressed beforehand
by the camera-driving mechanism. Continuous suction can
be produced either by a continuously driven pump, or by a
Venturi tube placed outside the fuselage. The Venturi tube
(Fig. <a href='#fig_055'>55</a>) consists of a pipe built up of two cones, placed
vertex to vertex, to form a constriction. When air is forced
through this at high velocity suction is produced in a small
diameter tube taken off at the constriction. A suction of two
centimeters of mercury, acting through holes about one centimeter
equidistant from each other in the back plate, has been
found adequate to hold flat a film 18 × 24 centimeters.</p>

<p class='c000'>One merit of suction applied only at the moment of
exposure is that the film-driving mechanism does not have
to work against the drag of the suction. Continuous suction,
on the other hand, gives a longer opportunity for flattening
out kinks in the celluloid, and easily permits movement of
the film during the exposure, either for the purpose of permitting
a longer exposure or for the purpose of preventing
distortion due to the focal-plane shutter. A disadvantage
of continuous suction is the production of minute scratches
on the celluloid surface as it drags over the suction plate.
These are ordinarily too small to cause trouble, but may show
up when printing is done in an enlarging camera.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Static discharges</strong> are produced by the friction of the
celluloid against the pressure back or other surfaces with
which it comes into contact. They show in the developed
film as branching tree-like streaks (Fig. <a href='#fig_056'>56</a>) and in cold dry
weather may be numerous enough to ruin a picture. The discharges
are noticeably less frequent with film coated on the back
with gelatine (“N.C.”), but the extra gelatine surface is extremely
undesirable. When handled by developing machines,
as large rolls must be, this back gelatine surface becomes
scratched and bruised in a serious manner. Plain unbacked
film is much to be preferred if the static can be obviated.</p>

<p class='c000'>To avoid static, it is necessary to provide for the immediate
dissipation of all acquired electrical charges. Experiments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>made by the United States Air Service have shown
that nothing is so good as rather rough cloth, thoroughly
impregnated with graphite, held in close contact with the
celluloid during as great a portion of its travel as possible.
In the United States Air Service film camera which uses
suction through a perforated back plate, the plate has been
covered with thin graphited cloth, and similar cloth sheets
are pressed against the film rolls by sheets of spring metal
(Fig. <a href='#fig_065'>65</a>). In cameras with this equipment no trouble has
been experienced with static.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Representative Film Cameras.</strong>—<em>The English F type</em>
(Williamson). This is one of the earliest cameras designed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>for film, as is indicated by the nature of the power drive,
which presupposes that the camera is to be carried on the
outside of the fuselage. Its essential features are shown in
Figs. <a href='#fig_057'>57</a> and <a href='#fig_058'>58</a>. It consists of a rectangular box with a cone
at the front on which is mounted a propeller, intended to be
rotated by the wind made by the motion of the plane. This
drives, through a governor controlled friction clutch, a train
of gears which draws the (5 × 4 inch) film across the focal
plane, sets and exposes the shutter at regular intervals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Above the camera, supported on a tripod, are a compass
and altimeter, both recording on a single dial, illuminated
from below by the light reflected from a circular white disc
painted on top of the camera. An image of the dial is thrown
on a corner of the film by a lens, whose shutter is actuated
in synchronism with the main focal-plane shutter. No
special means are provided for holding the film flat. Special
film with perforated edges is used.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camera was designed for mapping work on the
Mesopotamian and other fronts where no maps at all existed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><em>The Duchatellier</em> camera is essentially a film magazine to
fit on the standard French deMaria camera bodies, of the
18 × 24 centimeter size. In its simplest form it embodies a
shutter (the regular focal-plane shutter of the camera being
removed) and a film-moving mechanism, both actuated by
a single motion of the hand. Automatic and semi-automatic
operation are accomplished by an auxiliary mechanism to
which Bowden wires from the hand lever are attached. The
motive power is an air propeller. Variation of speed is obtained
by changing the point of contact of a roller on a friction
disc, the disc being directly connected to the propeller shaft,
the roller to the camera drive shaft.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most distinctive features of the Duchatellier camera
is its use of the focal-plane shutter to hold the film flat during
the exposure. As already explained, this is accomplished by
pressure, velvet strips on the shutter edges keeping the film
close against the back plate. The return of the shutter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>curtain to the “set” position is accomplished by locking it
to the film by perforating points, so that it is pulled across
as the film is wound. This introduces between each pair of
pictures a strip of tremendous over exposure, as wide as the
curtain opening. A fixed-aperture variable-tension shutter
is used. The magazine carries a roll of film long enough for
200 exposures, feeding the long way of the picture. When
film needs to be changed in the air, this is done by changing
the entire magazine, including its shutter.</p>

The film is unrolled from a small-diameter feeding roller on

mechanism is attached. By this means approximately equal
spacing of pictures on the film is assured. The film is held
flat by continuous contact with a glass plate, which is made of
yellow glass, so that it serves at the same time as a color filter.
The lens—of 8 to 12 inch focus—is equipped with a single
speed between-the-lens shutter. The operation of the
camera is entirely automatic. The interval between pictures
is controlled by varying the clock-work speed, through a lever
on the outside of the camera box. Protection of the camera

cushions mounted on a solid frame, to which the camera is
held by spiral springs attached to its sides.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Brock Film camera</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_060'>60</a>) is an entirely automatic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>very compact self-contained camera, taking one hundred
4 × 5 inch pictures. The motive power is clock-work, regulated
in speed by an escapement controlled by a flexible shaft
carried to a dial which may be fastened to the instrument board
or to some other convenient part of the plane. The lens is
6, 12, or 18 inch focus. The shutter is of the fixed-aperture
variable-tension type, of long travel, and with a flap behind
the lens for covering during the setting period. None of the
special means above described for holding the film flat are
provided. A metal plate resting on the back, and a flat
metal frame in front with a 4 × 5 inch aperture, are considered
sufficient check on the excursions of the small-sized film.
A ball bearing double pivoted frame serves to support the
camera in a pendulous manner, permitting it to assume a
vertical position after tilting. Damping of oscillations and
vibration is arranged for by two pneumatic dash pots.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>German film mapping camera</em>, shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_061'>61</a>, is
distinguished by a number of special features. The size of
the pictures, 6 × 24 centimeters, is unusual. It has its advantages,
however. Since the short dimension is in the line
of flight, the maximum width of field covered by the lens is
utilized (Fig. <a href='#fig_017'>17</a>). This of course necessitates a larger number
of exposures to complete a strip, which is perhaps an
added advantage, since the narrower the individual pictures
the better the junctions will be, especially if large overlaps
are made. This proved to be the case with captured German
mosaics. Difficulty is experienced in making overlaps on a
turn (Fig. <a href='#fig_062'>62</a>), but this is not a vital objection. The shutter
has a fixed aperture, narrower at the center than at the ends,
to compensate for the falling off in illumination away from
the center of the lens. No safety flap is needed because the
curtain moves in opposite directions on successive exposures,
thereby also compensating for shutter distortion, as has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>already been discussed. Shutter speed is controlled by varying
the tension of the actuating spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>The camera is driven by an electric motor, connected to a

The film is moved by rubber rollers which are cut away for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>part of the circumference, allowing the film to stand still

<p class='c000'><em>United States Air Service automatic film camera</em>—<em>Type K</em>
(Figs. <a href='#fig_064'>64</a>, <a href='#fig_065'>65</a>, <a href='#fig_092'>92</a>, <a href='#fig_093'>93</a>, <a href='#fig_098'>98</a>, <a href='#fig_099'>99</a>). This is an entirely automatic
camera, manufactured by the Folmer and Schwing Division
of the Eastman Kodak Co., taking 100 pictures of 18 × 24
centimeter size at one loading. As with all the American
cameras of this size, it uses the standard lens cones of any
desired focal length. The camera proper consists of a compact
chamber in which the film rollers are carried at each end
forward of the focal plane, the shutter lying between. In
consequence of this arrangement the vertical depth of the
camera is the absolute minimum—short of decreasing the
length of the optical path by mirror arrangements—making
it possible to suspend the camera diagonally in the American
and British planes, for taking oblique pictures.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flatness of the film is secured by a suction plate covered
with graphited cloth and connected with a Venturi tube.
The top cover is removed for re-loading. The shutters on
the first cameras of this type are of the variable-tension
fixed-aperture design, though later ones have the variable-aperture
curtain controlled by an idler, as used in the American
deRam. An auxiliary curtain shutter serves to cap the
true shutter during setting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The operation of the film driving mechanism is comparatively
simple. It consists of a train of gears, driven by a
flexible revolving shaft attached to some separate source of
power capable of speed variation. The action of the gears
is to move the film, set the shutter and then expose it; in the
earlier cameras with the film continuously moving. In the
first cameras constructed the space between the pictures
varies as the film rolls up, due to the increasing diameter of
the roll. In later cameras the film roller is disengaged from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the gears just before the shutter is tripped, so that the film
stands still during the exposure, and is then re-engaged at a
new point on a ratchet wheel governed by the diameter of
the receiving roll, whereby the pictures are equally spaced.
In all the cameras, punch marks made at the time of exposure
enable the limits of the picture to be detected in the dark
room by touch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Variable speed is arranged for in any one of several ways.
For peace-time uses a turbine attached to the side of the plane
is simple and positive, and, provided it is made of sufficient
size—which is not the case with the one shown in the Figure—will
give adequate speed regulation upon varying the
aperture through which the air enters. The Venturi tube
may be carried upon the same mount, or a small rotary pump
can be attached on the same shaft. Where the high wind
resistance of the turbine is an objection the camera is driven
electrically, by a motor acting through the intermediary of
a variable speed control described in the next chapter
(Fig. <a href='#fig_068'>68</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The camera weighs complete about forty pounds, and
the film rolls about four pounds. The latter can be changed

</div>

<p class='c006'>As long as circumstances permit, hand operation still
remains the most reliable and satisfactory method of driving a
camera. It is always available, can be applied to just the
amount desired, and at the time and place needed. For
instance, in a magazine of the Gaumont type (Fig. <a href='#fig_040'>40</a>), what is
needed is the periodic application of a very considerable
force rather quickly, and while this can be done quite simply
by hand, no mechanism has even been attempted to go through
this same operation automatically. Instead, the fundamental
design of automatic magazines has been made along other
lines calculated to utilize smaller forces more steadily applied.</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be granted, however, that for war planes, and
particularly for single seaters, cameras should be available
which are capable of operating semi-automatically or automatically.
This necessarily means the employment of artificial
power, whose generation, transmission to the camera
and control as to speed present a mechanical problem of no
small difficulty.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Available Sources of Power.</strong>—The sources from which
power may be drawn on the plane are four, although the
various combinations of these present a large number of
alternative approaches to the problem. These sources are:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>1. The engine of the plane.</div>
      <div class='line'>2. Wind motors.</div>
      <div class='line'>3. Spring motors.</div>
      <div class='line'>4. Electric motors.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>These may first be considered largely from the descriptive
standpoint, leaving questions of performance and efficiency
for separate treatment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Power may be derived directly from the engine through a
flexible shaft, similar to that used for the revolution counter.
This source of power is inherently the most direct and efficient,
since the engine is the seat of all the lifting and driving
energy of the plane. There is no loss through transformation
into other forms of energy, such as electrical; or by the use of
more or less inefficient intermediary apparatus, such as wind
propellers. Against the direct drive of the camera from
the engine may, however, be urged that the usual distance
between engine and camera is too great for reliable mechanical
connection, as by flexible shafting. Objections also arise
from the standpoint of speed. This cannot be controlled by
the camera operator; and varies over too wide a range, as the
engine changes from idling to full speed, to fit it for automatic
camera operation. The first objection may be met by that
combination of methods of power drive which consists in
transmitting the power electrically; that is, by letting the
engine operate a generator from which cables run to a motor
close to the camera. This method, of course, sacrifices
efficiency, and it breaks down when the engine speed drops
below the speed necessary to generate the requisite voltage.
This defect may in turn be met by floating in storage batteries,
which brings up the whole question of electrical drive,
to be treated presently. While use of the engine for direct
drive or for generating electric current has not been adopted
in the American service, it is known that some German
planes were supplied with electric current in this way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming next to the wind motors, these possess one very
great merit: they utilize a motive power that is always
present as long as the plane is in motion through the air.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>On the other hand, the process of using the main propeller
of the plane to pull another smaller propeller through the
air appears a roundabout way to utilize the driving power
of the airplane engine. Yet on the whole it is probable that
some form of propeller or wind turbine is the simplest and
most convenient device we have for the operation of airplane
auxiliaries. As long as the amount of power required is
small, such inefficiency as is inherent in its use is offset by
its convenience and reliability. An advantage of the propeller
is that its speed is almost directly proportional to that
of the plane through the air, a desirable feature in automatic
cameras provided the proportionality is under control.
Yet it is just in this matter of varying the speed at will that
the propeller presents difficulties, to be met only by additional
mechanisms for gearing down or governing. Propellers
have the practical disadvantage that they present an easily
bent or broken projection to the body of the plane (Figs. <a href='#fig_083'>83</a>
and <a href='#fig_084'>84</a>). The strength of small propellers for operating
auxiliaries is never so much in question with reference to
their resistance to whirling and thrust of air as it is to their
ability to withstand the inevitable knocks and careless handling
that will fall to their lot. The propeller bracket is just
what the pilot is looking for to scrape the mud off his boots
before climbing in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind turbine has the advantage over the propeller
that its speed can be varied rather simply by exposing more
or less of its face to the wind. A turbine fitted with an
adjustable aperture for admitting the wind is shown in Fig.
<a href='#fig_064'>64</a>, in connection with the type K automatic film camera.
The turbine has the advantage of being compact and lying
close against the body of the plane. In the form figured,
altogether too much head resistance is offered—just as much
for low as for high speeds—but with proper design this need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>not be the case. It is, moreover, quite too small to give the
needed speed regulation, as it only begins to operate near its
full opening.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Spring motors have the very real advantage that by their
use the camera can be made entirely self contained. The
simplest application of the spring motor would be to the semi-automatic
camera, where no close regulation of speed is
required. In such a camera the operation of exposing the
shutter would release the spring, which would then change
the plate or film and re-set the shutter, repeating this operation
as long as the spring retained sufficient tension. Small
film hand-cameras of this type, using self-setting between-the-lens
shutters, have been designed, though not for aerial
work. The possibilities of using springs as motive power
in semi-automatic cameras have not apparently been seriously
considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a spring motor is used for automatic camera operation
it at once becomes necessary to add to the motor an
elaborate clock mechanism for controlling and regulating its
speed of action. Springs are much better fitted for giving
power by quick release of their tension than by slow release,
and the necessary clock mechanisms for their regulation
become very heavy, as well as complicated and delicate,
when they are made large enough to do any real work. For
their repair they require the services of clock makers rather
than the usual more available kind of mechanic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming next to electric motors, we meet with a source of
power of very great flexibility both in its derivation and in
its application. If a source of electric current is already provided
for heating and lighting as it is on the fully equipped
military plane, and if it has sufficient capacity to handle the
camera, its use is rather clearly indicated, irrespective of
how efficiently or by what method it is produced. Especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>is this the case, from the standpoint of economy and simplicity,
if a propeller-driven generator is the source of current,
and the alternative power drive is an additional propeller
for the camera. If, on the other hand, the camera must have
its own source of electric power, the advantages and disadvantages
must be closely scrutinized. In this case either
a generator must be provided, or resort be made to storage
batteries, or a combination of the two.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ruling out a special propeller-driven generator, we are
left with either the generator driven from the engine or the
storage battery. Inasmuch as storage batteries are practically
indispensable with generators, in order to maintain the
voltage constant at all speeds, it is on the whole advisable
to rely upon batteries alone. An advantage of their use is
that the power plant is entirely within the plane: All projections
such as propellers are avoided. Another merit is that
the power is drawn upon only as needed. Against storage
batteries is their weight, the need for frequent charging,
and their loss of efficiency at low temperatures—a loss so
serious with those of the Edison form as to preclude their use.</p>

<p class='c000'>When once the source of electrical energy is decided upon,
its method of application needs to be considered. Here we
meet at once the peculiar merit of electrical energy, namely,
the ease and convenience with which it may be transmitted.
All we need is a pair of wires, led to any part of the plane by
any convenient route and connected by simple binding posts.
It may with equal ease be turned on or off by merely making
or breaking a contact with a switch. For operating semi-automatic
cameras this feature may be utilized in the interest
of economy, if the power is automatically turned off as soon
as the plate-changing operation is finished. Exceptionally
reliable make and break contacts are necessary to insure the
success of this latter scheme.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Two methods of transforming the supply of electrical
energy into mechanical motion are available. The first is
by the use of a solenoid and plunger. This is a device practically
restricted to semi-automatic cameras, in which the
operation consists of a straight to-and-fro motion, initiated
at the will of the operator. It has been used little if at all.
The second motion is the continuous rotary one secured by
the use of an electric motor. This motion is the most practical
one for the continuous operation of any mechanism, but
on the other hand requires that the imposed load be reasonably
uniform at all times through the cycle of operations.
Assuming that the camera mechanism is of this character,
the motor may be attached directly to the camera, or if it
must be so large as to cause danger by vibration, it may be
connected through a flexible shaft. This use of an electric
motor is very practical for semi-automatic cameras such as
the “L” or the American deRam, in planes supplied with a
suitable source of current.</p>

<p class='c000'>When it comes to entirely automatic cameras, where
uniform and regulatable speed is required, as in making
overlapping pictures for mapping, the electrical drive is not
so convenient. The shunt-wound motor runs at nearly
constant speed, while the series-wound motor in which the
speed can be regulated by the interposition of resistance,
has nothing like a sufficient range of variation for the purpose
(at least five to one is imperative) before it fails to carry
the load. Hence we must either incorporate in the camera
some mechanism for varying the interval between exposures
while the speed of the motor remains constant, or introduce
an auxiliary device to effect the required transformation in
speed. If we do use an auxiliary device the train of apparatus,
consisting of battery (or generator), motor, speed control
and camera, is altogether too long; it is apt to cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>annoying delays in connecting up in an emergency, and it
offers an excessive number of chances for break-down.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Performance and Efficiency Data.</strong>—The first step in
deciding upon methods of power drive, and indeed in deciding
whether power drive is feasible at all, is to assemble
definite data as to the power required to drive representative
cameras. Approximate figures for some of the cameras
described in previous chapters are:</p>

<p class='c000'>These requirements—not exceeding ⅒ horse power—are
insignificant in comparison with the total of 100 to 400
horse power available for all purposes from the plane's engine.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Propeller characteristics.</em> Data on the performance of
small propellers are somewhat meagre. However, the results
of the rather extensive researches on large ones, suitable for
driving planes, may be applied, with proper reservations, to
give a fair guide to the study of the application of small
propellers for driving plane auxiliaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first factor to be considered is the thrust or <em>head
resistance</em> offered by a propeller to motion through the air.
This varies as the <em>square of the velocity</em>, as the <em>density of the
medium</em>, and as the <em>area of the body</em> projected normally to the
wind, the formula being</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><em>T</em> = <em>cdaV</em><sup>2</sup></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>where <em>T</em> = thrust, <em>d</em> = density, <em>a</em> = area, <em>V</em> = velocity. Data
on the L camera propeller are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_066'>66</a>, where its
thrust both when free and when loaded with the camera is
given, as well as that of a solid disc of the same diameter as
the propeller. For this propeller, which is double-bladed,
and six inches in diameter, <em>cda</em> = .000275 with the load on.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>The total thrust amounts to only about three pounds when
the plane velocity is 100 miles per hour. The head resistance
of the whole plane is a matter of hundreds of pounds, so that
the propeller resistance is quite negligible.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 66.</span>—Wind propeller data.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The next factor is the speed of revolution of the propeller,
expressed in revolutions per minute. This varies with the
design—the number of blades, their area, and pitch. For a
given design the speed of revolution is <em>directly proportional
to the speed of motion through the air</em>, and to <em>the density of the
air</em>. Representative data for the L camera propeller are
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_067'>67</a>. It will be noted that the speed goes up to
8000 for 120 miles per hour air speed. This illustrates the
necessity for great strength to withstand centrifugal force.
Propellers should be constructed of tough material, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>subjected to whirling tests up to speeds considerably in
excess of any the plane will attain in any maneuver. At
low speeds the linear relationship fails, as a critical velocity
is reached—about 3500 r. p. m. for this propeller—where it
refuses to turn.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 67.</span>—Relation between air speed and propeller revolutions.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The fact that the speed of the propeller depends on the
density of the air has an interesting corollary, which is that
a propeller adequate at low altitudes will fail at high ones.
The density of the air varies with altitude according to the
following figures:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>At</td>
    <td class='c009'>3000 meters,</td>

    <td class='c009'>6000 meters,</td>
    <td class='c015'>52 per cent. of sea level</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>If we take the r. p. m. at 90 miles per hour at sea level as
6000, then at the above altitudes the speeds will be 4300,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>3500, and 3000, respectively. The last figure is below that
for which this size of propeller stalls with its normal load,
as noted in the last paragraph. Consequently, if flying is to
be done at these altitudes a larger propeller must be carried,
which will still deliver enough power at the lower density.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next factor to be considered is the <em>power furnished
by the propeller</em>. As a representative figure may be quoted
the performance of the L propeller. This gives 27 watts at
3600 revolutions per minute (56 miles per hour). From this
figure the performance of other propellers may be deduced
from the basic laws, which are: that the <em>power varies as the
density of the medium</em> and as the <em>cube of the velocity</em> (assuming
constant efficiency). Since the power delivered by the six
inch diameter L propeller is already adequate at 60 miles per
hour, the necessary dimension to function satisfactorily at
100 miles per hour would need to be only a little more than
three inches, except for the desirability of a safety factor for
high altitudes and low air densities.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>efficiency</em> of the propeller is defined by the relation—</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>power delivered by the propeller</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c013'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c014'>power supplied to the propeller</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>The denominator of this fraction is the thrust times the
velocity, for which the curves of Fig. <a href='#fig_066'>66</a> supply us data for
the L propeller. Using the figures 3600 r. p. m., 56 miles
per hour, and 27 watts, we find the efficiency to be about 50
per cent. This increases with the velocity, with a possible
upper limit of 70 to 80 per cent. Since the main propeller
of the plane is not over 80 per cent. efficient we have at most
an efficiency of 64 per cent. in using a propeller drive, as
compared with taking the power directly off the engine.</p>

<p class='c000'>In considering the use of <em>spring and clock-work motors</em> we
meet at once with the problem of comparing the effect on the
performance of a plane of a carried weight, as against a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>head resistance. The efficiency of a spring motor is measured
in terms of its weight, that of a propeller in terms of its head
resistance. The general answer to this question is given by
the relation that <em>a pound of dead weight is equivalent to ⅕
pound head resistance</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to apply this relation to the study of spring
motors for driving cameras, data are necessary on the power
delivery per pound weight of such mechanisms. Such data
are not easily accessible, largely because clock-work has not
generally been seriously considered as a motive power for
large apparatus. To arrive at an approximate figure we
may take the fact that in an 8 × 10 inch film camera designed
by one of the manufacturers who have utilized clock-work,
the motor weighed 30 pounds. This is equivalent to six
pounds head resistance. Now the type K, 18 × 24 centimeter
film camera is operated, even with the addition of a friction
drive speed control, by means of the L camera propeller. As
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_066'>66</a>, at 100 miles per hour the head resistance
of this propeller is still less than three pounds. Consequently,
it appears that from the efficiency standpoint the clock
mechanism is quite outclassed by the wind propeller.</p>

<p class='c000'>Coming next to the <em>electric motors</em>, the L camera and the
K are both operated satisfactorily with a <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>20</span></span> horse power
motor, weighing 6 pounds. For the deRam a ⅒ horse power
motor has been adopted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking up efficiency considerations, we have, if the current
is supplied by a generator from the engine, a transformation
factor of 70 to 80 per cent. from mechanical to electrical
energy and a similar factor in using a motor for the
camera. When batteries are employed the matter of weight
<em>versus</em> head resistance again arises. The batteries found
most satisfactory for operating the K and deRam cameras
are of the six-cell 12 volt lead type. Their capacity is 40
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ampère</span> hours at three ampères or 36 at five <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ampères</span>—more
than is necessary for a single reconnaissance, but a practical
figure when economy of charging and replacement are considered.
The weight of this unit is 27 pounds. To this must
be added the weight of the motor—6 lbs.—making a total
of 33 pounds, equivalent to a head resistance of nearly 7
pounds. This is more than twice the propeller head resistance
invoked to do the same work.</p>

<p class='c000'>These considerations of efficiency have been gone into
because they are usual in studying any engineering problem
and because of the insistent demand from the plane designer
that every ounce of weight and head resistance be saved.
Actually, as already stated, the load imposed by any method
of power drive is trivial in comparison with the whole load
of the plane. There is, however, an important reservation to
be made, which applies against clock-work and batteries:
This is, that while the equivalent head resistance of any
camera motive power carried as dead weight is small, its
effect on <em>balance</em> may not be so. While the use of a propeller
need not disturb the plane's balance, the weight of the camera
alone, without any driving apparatus, is already seriously
objected to on this score. The merely mechanical superiority
of the propeller as a source of motive power is on the whole
rather marked.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Control of Camera Speed.</strong>—In the semi-automatic
camera the only control required on the speed of the operating
motor is at the upper and lower limits. It must not go
so fast as to anticipate the completion of any steps in the
cycle of camera operation, such as the fall of plates or pawls
into position, which would jam the camera. On the other
hand, it must not be so slow that pictures cannot be obtained
with the requisite overlap for maps or stereoscopic views.
In the American deRam camera the cycle of operations cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>safely be put through in less than four seconds, a short
enough interval for most purposes. It is also highly desirable
in the semi-automatic camera to have the motive power
capable of stopping completely. This saves wear and tear
on both motor and camera mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the automatic camera an extreme range of speed is
called for by the several problems of mapping, oblique
photography, and the making of stereoscopic views. For
mapping alone, the shortest likely interval may be taken as
that required for work at approximately 1000 meters altitude,
for a plane speed of 150 kilometers per hour, which
demands an interval of six seconds with a ten inch lens on a
4 × 5 inch plate. For vertical stereos at the same altitude
and speed this interval is divided by three, and low oblique
stereos need even quicker operation. Hence a range of from
1 to 30 pictures per minute should be provided for. This
requirement is difficult to meet with any simple mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the standpoint of simplicity in speed regulation the
wind turbine of adequate vane surface has much to recommend
it. It is only necessary to present more or less of its
vane area to the wind in order to secure a considerable range
of speed. The method of doing this by a shutter interposed
in front is uneconomical, but it is probable that the design
can be so altered that more or less of the turbine is exposed
beyond the side of the plane, possibly by varying the angle,
to secure the same result without introducing useless head
resistance. A serious practical objection to the turbine lies
in the large vane surface necessary to give adequate power
combined with proper speed variation. In the automatic
film camera (Type K) this area should be as much as 40 to
50 square inches.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind propeller does not lend itself at all well to speed
variation. It cannot be partially covered from the air stream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>as can the turbine, because of the resulting strain on its
mount. A possible form of variable speed propeller, one
which, however, has not yet been practically developed, is a
propeller with controllable variable pitch. If this could be
made mechanically sound it would be well-suited for camera
operation. That such a propeller could be worked out is
indicated by the good performance of a constant speed
propeller developed for radio generators and used on the
French deRam camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_054'>54</a>). Parenthetically, it maybe
questioned whether a constant speed propeller is really desirable
with an airplane camera. What is required is not
exposures at a definite time interval—although most of the
data are in that form—but exposures at definite intervals
with respect to the motion of the plane, which practically
means with reference to its air speed. Rather than build a
camera calculated to give exposures at intervals of so many
seconds when it is attached to a constant speed propeller,
we would do better to use a propeller which responds to the
speed of the plane, in conjunction with some form of tachometer
to show the rate at which exposures are being made.
This in turn should be coördinated with the indications of a
proper camera-field indicating sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>One solution of the problem of speed control with a propeller
of practically fixed speed, is to use a governor and slip
clutch as in the English Type F film camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_057'>57</a>).
Here the propeller shaft and the camera driving axle are
connected by two friction discs. That on the camera mechanism
is forced against the other by a spiral spring, whose tension
is controlled by a ball governor. If the camera speed becomes
too high the governor reduces the tension on the spiral spring
and the discs slip over each other. The point where this slipping
occurs is determined by the position of the governor as a
whole, and this is controlled by a lever on top of the camera.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>Another speed control device, perhaps more positive but
certainly more complicated and wasteful of power, consists
of a large flat disc, driven by the propeller or electric motor,
and from which the camera is driven by a shaft from a smaller
friction disc which may be pressed against any point from
the center to the periphery of the larger disc. The speed
range attainable in this way is limited only by the size of
the large disc. An application of this idea is shown in the
speed control (Fig. <a href='#fig_068'>68</a>), designed for the American Type K
camera when operated on an electric motor or on a simple
propeller. The same idea is utilized in the Duchatellier film
camera, in connection with the constant speed propeller
already described.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 68.</span>—Friction disc speed control.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>On the whole it is eminently desirable from the standpoint
of power operation that the automatic camera should
embody its own means for altering the interval between
exposures, so that all the external attachment needed is a
single connection to a source of power either of constant
speed, as an electric motor, or of speed proportional to that
of the plane, as with a simple wind propeller. This makes the
camera largely independent of the nature of the power supply,
whereas a camera designed for a special variable speed device
is of little use on a plane where this is not available.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Transmission of Power to the Camera</strong>—It has already
been pointed out that the ease of transmission of electrical
energy makes it particularly convenient for use in a plane.
All other sources of power, except clock-work incorporated
in the camera, require flexible shafting, so that the question
of bearings and connections becomes a serious one, especially
when the shaft runs continuously for long periods at very
high speeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shafting found most suitable is the spirally wound
form commonly known as dental shafting. This must be
encased in a smoothly fitting sheath, flexible enough to permit
of easy bends. The ends of the shaft should be equipped
with square or rectangular pins to fit into corresponding slots
in the motor and camera shafts. The ends of the shaft casing
may be fitted either to attach by bayonet joints or by
smoothly fitting screw collars. At the point of attachment
to the camera it is desirable to have some form of junction
adjustable as to the direction from which the shaft may be
connected, so that it need be bent as little as possible. A
right angle bevel gear offers one means of doing this. Bearings,
such as those of the propeller, should be of the ball
variety, while heavy lubrication, such as vaseline, should be
freely used, both in the bearings and in the shaft casing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>An important feature of any power drive system should
be a safety device, so that the power will race in case of any
jam or stoppage in the camera. This will often prevent
serious damage through the breakage of some relatively
weak part of the camera mechanism on which the whole force
of the driving apparatus is suddenly thrown. The “L”
camera propeller is fitted with a spring friction clutch with
the idea that if the camera refuses to operate the propeller
will slip instead of wrenching the shaft to pieces.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <span class='large'>CAMERA AUXILIARIES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Distance Controls and Indicators.</strong>—All operations connected
with the exposing and changing of plates (except the
changing of whole magazines) should be arranged for accomplishment
at a distance. Other operations, such as changing
the shutter speed or the interval between exposures in an
automatic camera, which are usually done on the ground,
may sometimes be satisfactorily left for performance at the
camera. Conditions of extreme inaccessibility may, however,
make it necessary to carry even these controls to a distance.
Indicators of the number of exposures already made, and of
the readiness of the camera for the next exposure, may be
attached to the camera, but often are more profitably placed
at a distance. Distance control and indication are especially
necessary if the pilot makes the exposures—a common
English practice in two seaters, and the only recourse in
single seaters.</p>

<p class='c000'>When electric power is available, electrical distance control
devices are perhaps the simplest kind, as they transmit
motive power without displacing or jarring the camera.
Solenoids suffice for the simple pressing of releases or for
counting mechanisms, while small service motors may be
utilized for operations involving more work. A standing
practical objection to electrical control lies in the necessity
for using contacts, which are apt to be uncertain under
conditions that involve vibration.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>The Bowden wire</em>—a wire cable carried inside a heavy non-extensible
but flexible sheath—constitutes the most satisfactory
mechanical means for transmitting straight pulls.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>By means of “the Bowden” a pull may be transmitted so as
to be made entirely relative to two parts of the same body,
calling forth no tendency of the body as a whole to move.
Thus in the L camera shutter release (Fig. <a href='#fig_050'>50</a>), the releasing
lever with its attached counter is several feet distant from
the camera. If the plate bearing the lever and sheath end
is rigidly fastened down, the pressure exerted on moving the
lever acts between the lever and the end of the sheath. This
pressure passes immediately to the other end of the sheath,
while the pull on the wire is transmitted to its farther end on
the camera. In this way the conditions at the lever are
reproduced, but with the advantage that, due to the flexible
cable and sheath, any vibration of the lever support is
damped out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Due to its stretching, there is a pretty definite limitation
to the feasible length of the Bowden wire. This length is
about four feet. Where according to English practice the
pilot makes the exposure, a considerably longer wire and
sheath are called for. In this case the effective length of the
release is increased by giving the pilot a second releasing
lever, connected to the first by a rigid rod (Fig. <a href='#fig_069'>69</a>). The
releasing lever, wire, and all mechanical parts of the Bowden
release should be made much stronger than would be indicated
by bench tests of the camera. In the air it is impossible
to decide either by sound or by delicacy of touch
whether the mechanism has acted, so that the observer is apt
to pull much harder than necessary and to strain or break
the release if it is weak.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bowden wire is used in the American service only
for shutter release. In the English service it has been used
for plate changing with the L camera.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sights.</strong>—In airplane photography the need for a finder
or sight is fully as great as in everyday work. A new condition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>however, prevails, for except with hand-held cameras,
and even to some extent with them, the operation of pointing
the camera involves pointing the whole vehicle that carries
the camera. The pointing of airplane cameras is therefore
akin to the sighting of great guns. While the observer may
perform the actual operation of taking the picture, the
responsibility for covering the objective rests with the pilot.
Teamwork counts equally with tools. Airplane camera sights
may accordingly be divided into two classes: sights attached
to the camera, for use principally with hand-held apparatus,
and sights attached to the plane, for the use of pilot, of
observer, or of both.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sights for Hand-held Cameras.</strong>—The simplest form of
sight attached directly to the camera is modeled on the <em>gun
sight</em>, consisting of a forward point or bead and a rear V.
This sight of course serves merely to place the objective in
the center of the plate and gives no indication of the size
of field covered. Another simple sight of rather better type
is the <em>tube sight</em>—a metal tube of approximately one inch
diameter and three inches length, carrying at each end pairs
of wires crossed at right angles. The camera is in alignment
when the front and back cross wires both exactly match on
the object to be photographed. The best way to mount the
cross-wires is with one pair turned through 45 degrees with
respect to the other, so that it is at once apparent which is
the front and which the rear pair (Figs. <a href='#fig_031'>31</a> and <a href='#fig_039'>39</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Sights to indicate the size of the field</em> are usually less needed
on hand cameras than on fixed vertical cameras. Yet certain
circumstances make them most desirable, for instance in
naval work where a complete convoy must be included on
the plate. A sight of this kind can be made up of two wire
or stamped metal rectangles, a large one in front and a
smaller one behind, of such relative sizes and separations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>that the true camera field is outlined when the eye is placed
in position to see the two rectangles just cover each other.
The dimensions should be so chosen that the correct position
of the eye is approximately its natural location with respect
to the camera when this is held in the hands in the plane.
It is usual to provide the rectangular sights with cross-wires
to indicate the center of the field. Alternative rear sights
are simple beads or peep-holes—the use of the bead assuming
that the camera is held at about the right distance from the
eye for the rectangle to indicate the field. The peep-sight
is not a desirable form, as it is hard to hold the camera as
near the face as is necessary. These various types of rectangle
sights are well illustrated in the cameras shown in
Figs. <a href='#fig_038'>38</a>, <a href='#fig_040'>40</a> and <a href='#fig_186'>186</a>. They are all made so as to fold down
flat on the camera and to snap quickly open when needed.
The springs to support the sights must be fairly strong, and
the surface presented to the wind as small as possible. Wire
frames give very little from the pressure of the wind, but
flat metal frames are apt to be bent back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The position of the sight on the camera is important. If
the observer can stand, or if he sits up well above the edge
of the cockpit, the conventional position of the sight on a
pistol, namely, on top, is unobjectionable. But if the observer
sits very low, as he usually does, then the sight should
be on the bottom of the camera, thereby avoiding any need
for the observer to raise his head unduly into the slip stream.
Similarly, if the camera is used over the side for verticals,
as it is in flying boats, a sight on the top is impractical, since
it requires the observer to lean out dangerously far (Fig. <a href='#fig_185'>185</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sights Attached to the Plane.</strong>—Any of the sights just
described can be attached to cameras fixed in the plane, but
they would be useless in the positions ordinarily occupied
by the camera. It has therefore become common practice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>to attach the camera sight to some accessible part of the
plane. The most primitive method of sighting is merely to
look downward over the side—a method in general use to
the very end of the Great War. One step in advance of this
is to mark a large inverted V
on the side, with its vertex at a
point where the observer can
place his eye and so see the
fore and aft extension of the
field of view covered by the
camera. This kind of sight
was common on the French
“photo” planes. On some of
the English planes the tube
sight was carried on the outside
of the cockpit. Any of
the sights described can be
carried on the inside of the
fuselage, provided a hole is
cut in the floor. For satisfactory
sighting a hole in the
floor is really necessary, as it
enables the terrain on both
sides of the vertical to be
seen. One drawback to the
simple hole, however, is that it
cannot be made large enough
to show the whole field from
the ordinary height of the observer's eye, thus forcing him
to bring his head down near the floor. This difficulty is
gotten over in a very beautiful way by the use of the <em>negative
lens sight</em> shown diagrammatically in Fig. <a href='#fig_071'>71</a>.</p>

The lens is to be marked with a rectangle showing the shape
and size of the camera field, and a central mark such as a
cross. An upper rectangle, or a bead, or a pair of cross wires
a few inches below the lens, may be used for the other sight.
For precision work the sight above or below the lens should
be adjustable in position, especially where the camera suspension
permits the camera to be adjusted for the angle of
incidence of the plane.</p>

<p class='c000'>A negative lens sight should be placed in the observer's
cockpit, if he takes the pictures, and also in the forward cockpit,
so that the pilot may be accurately guided in his part of
the task. In addition, it is advisable to place a negative lens
well forward in the pilot's cockpit, to enable him to see the
country some distance ahead. The lenses should be planoconcave
with the flat side upward; otherwise, all the loose
dirt in the airplane settles in the middle of the concave depression.
A negative lens sight in a metal frame forming a
completely self-contained unit ready for mounting in the
plane is shown in Figs. <a href='#fig_072'>72</a> and <a href='#fig_073'>73</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Devices for Recording Data on Plates.</strong>—<em>Numbering
devices.</em> The number of the camera is impressed on negatives
taken with the American L camera through the agency of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>small transparent corner of celluloid. It would be entirely
possible to incorporate a rotating disc which should turn by
the operation of plate changing and carry a series of numbers,
so that each exposure could be numbered serially. Numbering
of individual plates is more commonly done by holes,
notches, or even numerals, in the turned over portion of the
sheaths, which are then recorded photographically when a
picture is taken (Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>). The chief objection to this method
is the difficulty of keeping the sheaths together in sets,
especially as individual ones become damaged or lost. In
practice there is also danger of the sheaths being carelessly
loaded in wrong order.</p>

<p class='c000'>The more ambitious idea of recording on the plate all the
information given by the instrument board of the plane
occurs independently and spontaneously to all aerial photographic
map makers. These ideas vary from attempts to
photograph the actual instrument board on every plate—a
difficult task indeed with the instruments and camera placed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>as they are in the ordinary plane—to the incorporation of
compass, altimeter, and inclinometer in the camera itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Figure 58 shows the plan adopted in the English F type
film mapping camera already described, for photographing a
compass and an altimeter on the film. Here the combined
compass and altimeter dial is above the camera, and is
mounted in a cell with a glass bottom. Below it is a lens
focussing the needles and compass points on the plane of the
film. The light for photography is furnished by a diffusely
reflecting white surface on top of the camera, illuminated
by the sky. (The camera was carried outboard.) In Fig. <a href='#fig_056'>56</a>
is shown a picture with the compass image impressed upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Figure 74 shows a type of inclination indicator found in
some captured German cameras. It consists essentially of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>two small pendulums or plumb-bobs; one to indicate lateral,
the other longitudinal inclination, arranged to be photographed
in silhouette on the plate, as shown in the lower
part of the diagram and in the print from a captured negative
(Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Both these devices suffer from the deficiencies of the
instruments they photograph. The compass and the inclinometer,
as already mentioned in the discussion of airplane
instruments, only behave normally in straight-away flying,
failing to indicate correctly when the plane is subject to
accelerations in any direction. In general all attempts to
record directional data in the camera are of little promise,
unless either the instruments or the camera are automatically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>held level by some gyroscopic device. If the instruments are
so controlled, rather elaborate means for photographing them
are necessary. If the camera is stabilized, the inclinometers
are unnecessary, and the compass behaves rationally.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another scheme for indicating inclinations, which is not
subject to the above objections, is to photograph the horizon
either on a separate film or on the same sensitive surface,
simultaneously with the principal exposure. The difficulty
here is the practical one that it is only feasible in localities
of great atmospheric clearness. Ordinarily, especially anywhere
near the sea-coast, the horizon is too rarely seen to be
a reliable mark (Fig. <a href='#fig_004'>4</a>). It is possible, however, that this
objection could be overcome by the use of specially red
sensitive plates and suitable color filters, as discussed in the
chapter on “Filters.” The method would in any case be
useless in mountainous country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The difficulties discussed with reference to direction indicating
instruments of course do not hold with the altimeter.
Ordinarily, though, the altitude changes slowly enough to
permit of sufficiently accurate records being made by pencil
and pad. For high precision map making a photographic
record of altimeter readings has a legitimate claim. As we
have seen, a small altimeter is incorporated in the English F
camera, but the bulk which a really precision altimeter
would assume would be a bar to its use in this way. A time
or serial number record on the plate or film, synchronized
with a similar record on the film of an auxiliary camera
which photographs the altimeter and other instruments,
may be the simplest way to preserve the majority of the
desired data.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Devices for Heating the Camera.</strong>—Parts of the camera
mechanism which depend on the uniformity of action of
springs or upon adequate lubrication are susceptible to change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>with variation of temperature. At high altitudes low temperatures
are met which may freeze ordinary machine oils
or may cause springs to seriously alter their tension, even to
break. To meet this difficulty, and probably also to dispel
the occasional condensation of moisture on the optical parts,
the German cameras are equipped with an electrical heating
coil placed just below the shutter, and arranged to connect
with the general heating and lighting current of the plane.
Two contacts are ordinarily provided, for offsetting the
effects of temperatures of -15 and -30 degrees centigrade.
An additional function of this heating coil is perhaps to
maintain the sensitiveness of the plates or film.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>General Theory.</strong>—In addition to the limitation of exposure
set by the ground speed of the plane another limitation
is set by the <em>vibration</em> of the camera. This may be
caused either by the motor, or by the elastic reactions of the
plane members to the strains of flight. Unlike the movement
of the image due to the simple motion of the plane,
movements due to vibration may be eliminated by proper
anti-vibrational mounting of the camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect of vibration may show as an indistinctness of
the whole image—this is its only effect with a between-the-lens
shutter—or as a band or bands of indistinctness parallel
to the curtain opening (Fig. <a href='#fig_076'>76</a>). These are due to shocks
or short period vibrations during the passage of the focal-plane
shutter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The obvious remedy for vibration troubles is to mount
the camera on some elastic, heavily damping support, like
sponge rubber or metal springs. Such a mounting should,
however, be designed on sound principles derived from a
proper analysis of the nature and effect of the possible
motions of the camera. Otherwise, the vibrational disturbances
may be increased rather than diminished by the camera
mount. Such an analysis, based merely on general mechanical
principles, shows that all motions of the camera are
resolvable into <em>six</em>. These are three <em>translational</em> motions,
namely, two at right angles in one plane such as the horizontal,
and one in the plane at right angles to this (vertical);
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and three <em>rotational</em> motions, one about each of the above
directions of translational motion as an axis (Fig. <a href='#fig_077'>77</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Brief consideration will show that only the latter—the
rotational motions—are of any importance when the small
displacements due to vibration are in question. To illustrate
the negligible effect of vibrations which merely move the
camera parallel to itself in any direction it is only necessary
to imagine the camera moved parallel to the ground through a
large distance, such as 10 centimeters. Now 10 centimeters
motion of the camera at 3000 meters elevation means, with
a 25 centimeter camera lens,</p>

<p class='c000'>motion on the plate, which would be only a tenth the distance
separable by a good lens. If we reduce this motion to the
small fraction of a centimeter which vibration would actually
produce, it is evident that such vibration is of absolutely
no importance. Similarly, if we imagine the camera, under
the same conditions, moved vertically with reference to the
ground by ten centimeters, the scale of the picture would
merely be changed by <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>12000</span></span> or by <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>1000</span></span> centimeter on a
12 centimeter plate, again quite negligible.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we consider motions of rotation, however, the case
is quite different. If the camera is mounted so that the
effect of any vibration is to rotate it around a horizontal
axis, this is exactly equivalent to rotating the beam of light
from the lens so that it sweeps across the plate. Thus a
millimeter displacement of the lens of the camera with the
plate remaining fixed gives approximately a millimeter motion
of the image. Consequently, a rotation producing only
a fraction of a millimeter's relative motion of lens and plate
during the period the curtain aperture is over a given point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>would cause fatal blurring—and the visible vibration of
plane longerons and cross members is easily of half millimeter
amplitude or more. Reduced to angular units it is
easily shown that a rotation of one degree per second—which
is quite slow as plane oscillations go—is beyond the limits
of toleration. Translational motions
of large amplitude may be
allowed, but the mounting of the
camera must not permit these
translations to be at all different
for different parts of the camera.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The proper way to eliminate
vibrational effects is to devise a
mounting that will transmit only
the translational shocks or that
will transform the rotational ones
into translations. Platforms
pivoted and cross-linked so as to
be free to move only parallel to
themselves (described in the next
chapter) represent one attempt
to reach this result. Quite the
simplest and most scientific form
of mounting to achieve this end is
to support the camera solely <em>in the
plane of the center of gravity</em>. The
principle here involved is easily grasped if we note that when
we jar a camera supported above or below its center of
gravity, the effect is to start the camera vibrating with the
center of gravity oscillating pendulum-like about the point
of support. The closer the center of gravity to the center
of support, the smaller the moment of the body about the
latter point.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><strong>Experimental Study of Methods of Camera Support.</strong>—Conclusive
evidence as to the merits of any system of camera
mounting can be obtained only under conditions that eliminate
the effect of other variables which may be equally
efficacious in diminishing the effects of vibration, but which
have only limited application. Very brief exposures—<span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>500</span></span>
second and less—will, for instance, result in good pictures
with almost any condition of vibration. Hence a sharp
picture offers no proof of the merits of a camera mounting
unless it is known that the exposure was no shorter than the
limit set by the ground speed of the plane. In fact it may be
said that the chief object of studying methods of camera
suspension is to increase the allowable exposure to a maximum,
thus lengthening the working hours and multiplying
the useful working days for aerial photography.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most satisfactory method of test yet developed is to
fly over a light or a group of lights on the ground with the
camera shutter open. In the first use of this method, which
originated in the English Service, such flights were made at
night, but later it was found that good results could be got
by placing the lights in a forest and making the tests when
the sun was fairly low. One of the group of lights must be
periodically interrupted, at a known rate, to furnish the
time intervals.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Some characteristic “trails” obtained by this method of
test are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_078'>78</a>. The first trail is that given by a
camera rigidly fastened to the fuselage. The second and
third show hand camera trails, made by an inexperienced
and by an experienced observer, respectively. They show
by comparison with the other figures that the human body
is an excellent block to vibration, but in unskilled hands a
poor check to rapid erratic (probably rotational) motions
of the camera. The fourth is the trail given by a camera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>supported by gimbals bedded in sponge rubber accurately
in the plane of the camera's center of gravity. Other trails
are shown in the next chapter in connection with the description
of practical camera mountings. Clearly the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>suspension is that giving the smallest amplitude of displacement
during the interval of time covered by an average
exposure. It is, in fact, possible to determine from these
trails the permissible exposure for any assumed permissible
blurring of the image. The rigid mounting trail indicates
very bad conditions, calling for literally instantaneous
exposures. The center of gravity trail, at the other extreme,
shows practically no limitation of exposure in so far as vibration
is concerned, thus bearing out the theoretical conditions
above discussed. An interesting conclusion from these
experiments is that a rapidly running motor gives less harmful
vibration than a slow one, although in the war it was a
common practice to throttle the motor before exposing. As
might be expected, the greater the number of cylinders,
the shorter the period and the smaller the amplitude of
the vibration.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Pendular Camera Supports.</strong>—The design of the camera
support may be approached from a different standpoint,
namely, with the aim of carrying the camera so that it will
tend to hang always vertical. In mapping this is of fundamental
importance. It is, indeed, a question whether aerial
mapping will ever be worthy of ranking as a precision method
unless the camera can be mounted so that its pictures are
taken in the horizontal, undistorted position.</p>

<p class='c000'>The simplest way to hold the camera vertical is to mount
it on gimbals, with its center of gravity below the point of
support. When so mounted the camera swings as a pendulum.
Delicacy of response to variation of level is obtained
by leaving a considerable distance between the center of
gravity and the center of support. Oscillation about the
vertical position is to be prevented by some system of dash
pots or other damping. A suspension of this kind is furnished
with the Brock film camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_060'>60</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>It will be seen at once that the relation of center of
gravity to center of support called for here is in direct contradiction
to the requirements for eliminating vibration.
Either one requirement or the other must be sacrificed, or
else a compromise made in which neither delicate response to
inclination of the plane nor fully satisfactory freedom from
vibration is attained. This is a very serious objection to the
pendular support. But the really vital objection to the
pendular support is that it performs its function only very
partially. It is entirely satisfactory only under conditions
of steady flying, as in a uniform climb or glide, with the plane
tail or nose heavy, or in flying with one wing down. As
soon as we introduce any acceleration, as in making a turn,
the camera follows the plane and not the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is true that mapping photography is done from a plane
flying as level as possible, and that except under bad air conditions
it holds its course with very little turning, if handled
by a skilled pilot. Nevertheless, a surprisingly small deviation
from straight flying causes quite serious variations from
the vertical. It is of interest to calculate how large may be
the horizontal accelerations that accompany swervings
from a straight course which one might think insignificant.
For instance, consider the horizontal acceleration due to
a turn having a radius of a kilometer when the plane is
moving at 100 kilometers per hour. If <em>a</em> is the acceleration,
<em>v</em> the velocity of the plane, and <em>r</em> the radius, we
have from elementary dynamics that</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the tangent of the angle of deviation from the vertical,
from which the angle turns out to be about 4½ degrees,
a very considerable error, rapidly multiplied as the speed of
the plane is increased. It is, indeed, open to question whether
the average deviations from the vertical are not apt to be
less with the camera rigidly fixed to the plane, if guided by
a skilled pilot who will hold the ship level at the expense
of “skidding” the slight turns he must make to hold
his direction.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Gyroscopic Mountings.</strong>—The ideal support for the
aerial camera will undoubtedly be one embodying gyroscopic
control of the camera's direction. By proper utilization of
the principles of the gyroscope it is to be expected that not
only can the camera be maintained vertical, but it may be
supported anti-vibrationally as well. At the present time
the problem of gyroscopic control is in the experimental
stage, so that only the elements of the problem and the possible
modes of solution can be laid out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gyroscope consists essentially of a heavy ring or
disc rotating at a high speed on an axis free to point in any
direction (Fig. <a href='#fig_079'>79</a>). If mounted so that the axes of the supporting
gimbals pass through the center of gravity of the
rotating disc, the result is a <em>neutral</em> gyroscope. Its characteristic
is that its axis maintains its <em>direction fixed</em>, but this
fixity is with respect to space and not with respect to the
gravitational vertical. Consequently, as the earth revolves
the inclination of the gyroscopic axis changes with respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>to the earth. In latitude 45° this change is approximately a
degree in five minutes. Furthermore, the action of friction in
the supports, which can never be entirely eliminated, also
acts to slowly alter the direction of the gyroscopic axis.
Therefore, unless some <em>erector</em> is applied even the gyroscope
will not perform the task required of it.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 79.</span>—Diagram of simple gyroscope.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Before discussing possible forms of erectors it may be
noted in general, first, that these must depend upon gravity;
second, that such being the case, they must respond to the
resultant of gravity and any acceleration, that is, to the
<em>apparent</em> or <em>pseudo-gravity</em>. As already seen, this pseudo-gravity,
during a turn, is exactly what limits the usefulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>of the pendular support, and necessitates recourse to the
gyroscope. The problem thus becomes one of making an
erector-gyroscope combination which will respond to true
gravity and not to pseudo-gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general this problem would be insoluble, since there is
no difference in the nature of the acceleration of gravity and
that due to centrifugal force. A way out is offered, however,
by the fact that true gravity acts continuously and at a
small angle to the axis of the gyro, while the components
which cause the pseudo-gravity are of short duration, liable
to rapid changes of direction, and, on a turn, act at a large
angle. What we require, therefore, is an erector which will
respond slowly but surely to the <em>average</em> acceleration, which
is downward, but too sluggishly to be affected by the shorter
period accelerations due to turns or rolls. Slowness of
response is a matter of the erecting forces being small and of
the mass and angular velocity of the gyro disc being large.
The success of the compromise called for depends on the
relative times taken for the gyroscope to tilt seriously from
the true vertical, due to the causes above mentioned, and
for the average turn or roll. Fortunately the former is a
matter of minutes, the latter of seconds or at the worst of
fractions of a minute. More than this, since the roll or turn
is apt to be of much greater angle than any normal deviation
of the gyroscopic axis from the vertical in the same time, we
are offered the possibility of some device for filtering out the
deviations which alone are to effect the erector. For instance,
by shunting the restoring force whenever it is called upon to
act through more than a predetermined small angle.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the method of erecting the gyroscope, its characteristic
property must be kept in mind. This is that the
axis does not tilt under an applied force in the direction it
would if the gyro were not rotating, but around an axis at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>right angles to that of the applied couple. Thus in Fig. <a href='#fig_079'>79</a>,
if a weight is attached as shown, the disc does not incline
downward toward the weight, around the axis <em>Y</em>, <em>Y´</em>, but
<em>precesses</em> about the vertical axis Z, Z´. Some means is
therefore needed to translate the pull which any gravitational
control, such as a freely swinging pendulum, would
give, into a pull with <em>at least a component</em> at a finite angle
to this.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Gray stabilizer several metal balls are slowly
rotated in a tray above the center of gravity of the gyroscope.
Specially shaped grooves or compartments limit the freedom
of motion of these balls so that when the gyro is inclined the
balls travel at different distances from the center on the
ascending and descending sides. By this scheme a couple is
produced about the axis through the center and the low point
of the disc, which tilts the apparatus to the gravitational
vertical. In an alternative form the balls are carried past
the low point by their momentum and are prevented from
returning by the walls of the containing compartment, which
have meanwhile been advanced by the rotation of the erector
as a whole. The net result is to shift the center of gravity
of the system of balls in the proper direction to erect the
gyro. The rectifying action is purposely made quite slow
so that the displacements of the balls due to pseudo-gravity
will be averaged out.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a design due to Lucian, small pendulums work through
electric contacts to actuate solenoids which in turn move
small weights in the appropriate directions to give the
desired tilt. Response is made fairly quick and delicate,
and pseudo-gravity, due to turns and rolls, is rendered inoperative
by the contacts breaking whenever the pendulums
swing more than three or four degrees. This can only
happen if they move too quickly for the erecting forces to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>act, reliance being here placed on the characteristic differences
of action in respect to time of real and pseudo-gravitational
forces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides the neutral gyroscope as just considered there is
the pendular or top type, in which the center of gravity is
not in the plane of the supports. In general this type depends
on a couple resulting from the gravitational pull and the
inevitable friction of the supports to slowly tilt the axis to
the gravitational vertical. This type is slower to respond
than the designs in which a definite couple in the proper
direction is provided and it reaches the true vertical only
through a circuitous path.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 80.</span>—Diagram of camera linked to gyroscopic stabilizer.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Three methods of controlling a camera by a gyroscope
are suggested. One is to fasten the gyroscope rigidly to the
camera and mount the whole system on gimbals. A second
is to mount both camera and gyro side by side on gimbals,
linking the two so that the camera is moved parallel to the
gyro (Fig. <a href='#fig_080'>80</a>). A third method is to utilize the gyro to
make electric contacts to operate motors which in turn move
the camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considerable weight and space are required for a gyroscope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>capable of stabilizing a camera. The rotating disc
should be about half the weight of the camera, and with its
mounting may be expected to double the room required for
the camera alone. Motive power for maintaining the gyro
in continuous rotation may be supplied by an air blast, or
the gyro may be made up as an induction motor—the latter
necessitating an alternating current supply.</p>

<p class='c000'>In view of the space and weight limitations in a plane it
is a question still to be decided whether it is more economical
to stabilize the camera or to stabilize an inclinometer and
photograph its indications simultaneously with the release
of the shutter which takes the aerial picture.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <span class='large'>PRACTICAL CAMERA MOUNTINGS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>General Considerations.</strong>—Camera mountings as used
during the war were far from being developed on the basis
of scientific study or test. At first the need for special supporting
apparatus was not realized, and the suspensions
later in use were largely field-made affairs, often dependent
on adjustments made according to individual taste. Through
lack of accurate methods of test and of conclusive evidence
on the subject, it was quite common to find extremists who,
on the one hand, denied the efficacy of suspensions in general,
and on the other ardently supported crazily conceived supporting
arrangements which accurate comparative test show
to be even worse than useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the French service, despite numerous types of suspension
available, the very general practice was to lift
the camera from its support and hold it between the knees.
Or else the hand was pressed on the top of the camera
during exposure, more reliance being placed on the damping
qualities of the body than on any of the rubber or
spring mechanisms.</p>

<p class='c000'>As is clearly shown by the experimental data described
in the last chapter, a correctly designed supporting device,
carrying the camera accurately in the plane of its center of
gravity, accomplishes practically perfect elimination of
vibrational troubles. So important is the use of a mount and
so important is it that the mount should be correctly dimensioned
and adjusted for the camera, that an entirely different
attitude should be adopted from the prevalent one which
focuses attention on the camera and regards the mounting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>as a mere auxiliary to be left more or less to chance. <em>The
mounting should be considered an integral part of the camera.</em>
The man in the field should receive camera and mount
together, leaving as his only problem the attachment of the
complete camera—and—mount unit to the plane. This may
be arranged, by proper designing, to be a simple matter
of rigid bolting or strapping, requiring ingenuity perhaps
but not the scientific knowledge which is required for
mounting design.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Outboard Mountings.</strong>—In the English service the
camera was first attached to the plane outside the fuselage
by a rigid frame, to which the camera was strapped or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>bolted (Fig. <a href='#fig_081'>81</a>). Obvious objections exist to placing the
camera in this position, such as the resistance of the wind
and the difficulty of changing magazines. However, in the
earlier English planes with their fuselages of small cross
section no other accessible place for the camera was to be
found. Vibrational disturbances with the rigid outboard
mounting are quite serious, as is so clearly indicated by the
trace shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_078'>78</a>. Extremely short exposures are
alone possible, and a very large proportion of the pictures
are apt to be indistinct.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Floor Mountings.</strong>—A step in advance of the outboard
mounting is to support the camera snout in a padded conical
frame on the floor of the plane (Fig. <a href='#fig_082'>82</a>). This mounting
avoids the objection on the ground of wind resistance that
holds with the outboard, and has possibilities of being worked
out as an entirely satisfactory support. Yet to be satisfactory,
the point of support must lie in the plane of the
center of gravity of the camera, and the camera must be of a
type that preserves its center of gravity unchanged in position
as the plates are exposed. Unless these conditions are
fully met the floor mounting gives results little better than
does the outboard.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Cradles or Trays.</strong>—Floor space in the cockpit being
unavailable in the battle-plane, due to duplicate controls,
bomb sights, etc., the English service was driven to the practice
of carrying the camera in the compartment or bay
behind the observer. Here it was attached either to the
structural uprights or longerons, or to special uprights and
cross-pieces built into the plane to serve photographic ends.
As an intermediary between the camera and the supporting
cross-pieces there was introduced the camera <em>tray</em> or <em>cradle</em>.
This is essentially a frame carrying sponge rubber pads into
which the camera is more or less deeply bedded. Figs. <a href='#fig_083'>83</a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span><a href='#fig_084'>84</a> show an American L camera cradle based on the design
of the English L camera tray. Thick sponge rubber pads
support the two ends of the camera top plate, and additional
pads are provided to hold the nose of the camera. Careful
tests show this cradle to be superior to the outboard mounting,
but still leave much to be desired. Its performance is
better with the nose of the camera left free.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Tennis-ball Mounting.</strong>—A very simple mount used by
the French consists of a frame enclosing the nose of the
camera, and carrying four tennis balls, on which the whole
weight rests (Fig. <a href='#fig_040'>40</a>). If the center of support is in the plane
of the center of gravity and if the four balls are of uniform
age and elasticity, this form of support is good. As provided
by the camera manufacturer, the tennis ball frame fits much
too far down on the camera. Another application of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>tennis ball idea was frequently made in the French service,
in which the balls were close up under the shutter housing
(Fig. <a href='#fig_085'>85</a>). Additional support was, however, given to the
camera nose by flexible rubber bands, the success of the
whole being largely a matter of the adjustment of the tension
on the bands.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Parallel Motion Devices.</strong>—A form of suspension favored
by the French consists of parallel bell cranks, rigidly linked
together and held up by springs. Mountings of this sort
are illustrated in Figs. <a href='#fig_086'>86</a>, <a href='#fig_087'>87</a>, <a href='#fig_088'>88</a> and <a href='#fig_096'>96</a>. The guiding principle
is that any sort of shock will be transformed into a
straight up-and-down or side-wise motion of the camera,
which is harmless. The mounting as adapted by the English
surrounds the camera body, making the plane of support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>somewhere near the center of gravity. In certain of the
French suspensions employing this principle the whole
camera is hung below the bell cranks (Fig. <a href='#fig_086'>86</a>), and then the
nose is restrained by heavy rubber bands. The net result
is largely a matter of adjustment.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Tests on the English design made in the United States
Air Service appear to show that the chief virtue of the mounting
lies in the approximation of the point of support to the
center of gravity in the English cameras. A deRam camera
supported by its cone, so that its center of gravity was considerably
above the center of support gave rather poor results
(Fig. <a href='#fig_089'>89</a><em>a</em>), but when the bell cranks were attached near the
center of gravity, highly successful results were obtained
(Fig. <a href='#fig_089'>89</a><em>b</em>). The French deRam camera as ordered for the
American Expeditionary Force was fitted with a bell crank
supported in this position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Figures 90 and 91 show a bell crank mounting furnished
with a rotating turret. This was designed to facilitate the
changing of magazines in the English B M camera, which
is swung around through 90 degrees from the exposing
position to bring the magazine near the observer. The
camera shown in the mounting is the American hand-operated
model (type M), in which there is the same necessity for
turning in order to manipulate the bag magazine easily.
The camera is shown in both exposing and plate changing
positions. An important detail of these mounts is a <em>safety
catch</em>, which must be fastened before the plane lands, in
order to prevent the shocks of landing from producing
oscillations sufficient to throw the camera out of the mount.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Center of Gravity Rubber Pad Supports.</strong>—Given a camera
whose center of gravity does not change during operation, a
simple and entirely adequate anti-vibration support is furnished
by a ring of sponge rubber in the plane of the center of
gravity. But if provision has to be made for oblique views
or for adjusting the camera to the vertical, something more
elaborate is necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mountings for the American deRam and for the Air
Service film camera, embodying the results of complete
study of the anti-vibration problem, are shown in Figs. <a href='#fig_090'>90</a>,
<a href='#fig_092'>92</a> and <a href='#fig_093'>93</a>. Trusses carrying the cameras on pivots rest on
four pads of sponge rubber which are mounted on frames
correctly spaced ready for attachment to the cross-pieces
of the airplane camera supports. In the deRam (Fig. <a href='#fig_090'>90</a>)
the pivots, attached to the camera body, permit it to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>leveled fore and aft, to compensate for the inclined position
of the fuselage assumed at high altitudes or in some conditions
of loading. This will sometimes amount to as much
as 11 or 12 degrees, which is very serious, since one degree
causes (with an angular field of 20 degrees) about one per
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>cent. difference of scale at the two sides of the plate. The
film camera mounting carries the camera in a conical ring,
and is pivoted not only for vertical adjustment, but for the
taking of obliques as well (Fig. <a href='#fig_093'>93</a>). These mounts transmit
practically no vibration.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>A caution must be noted with regard to center of gravity
mountings. Any change in the camera, in particular the
substitution of a short for a long lens cone, must be made so
as to cause no alteration of the relative positions of the center
of support and the center of gravity. Either the short cone
must be weighted, or additional supporting pivots must be
provided in the plane of the new center of gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Italian and G. E. M. Mountings.</strong>—These mounts
(Figs. <a href='#fig_049'>49</a> and <a href='#fig_059'>59</a>) are similar in that the protection from
vibration is furnished by an elastic support at the bottom of
the camera. Tests show that these two cameras give very
similar results, of the unsatisfactory sort to be expected from
this kind of mounting in view of the lessons of the last
chapter on the proper point of support. Fig. <a href='#fig_094'>94</a>, <em>a</em>, shows a
trace given by the Italian mount. The permissible exposure,
on the criterion adopted, is very short with either mount,
about <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>200</span></span> second.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Brock Suspension.</strong>—This consists of a pair of frames
into which the camera is fitted by ball bearing pivots, so
that it is free to move in any direction (Fig. <a href='#fig_060'>60</a>). In order to
permit gravity to control the direction of the camera, the
point of support is made considerably (ten inches) above the
center of gravity. Air dash pots are provided for damping the
swings. As already explained, the pendular method of support
is in basic contradiction to the requirements for vibration
elimination. Tests of the Brock suspension, shown in Fig.
<a href='#fig_094'>94</a>, <em>b</em>, indicate it to be of low efficiency in damping out the short
period vibrations which are responsible for poor definition.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <span class='large'>THE INSTALLATION OF CAMERAS AND MOUNTINGS IN PLANES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Conditions to Be Met.</strong>—The characteristic difficulty
in installing the airplane camera is that there is no place for
it. After the gasoline supply, the armament, the wireless,
the oxygen tank, the bombs, and other necessities are taken
care of there is neither space available nor weight allowable.
Where space may be found it will be inaccessible, or accessible
only through a maze of tension and control wires; or
it will be in a position where any weight will endanger the
balance of the plane. Plane design has in fact been more or
less of a conflict between the aeronautical engineer, who is
designing the airplane primarily as a machine to fly, and the
armament and instrument men, who look upon it as a platform
for their apparatus. Lack of appreciation of the
extreme importance of aerial photography resulted, during a
large part of the war, in the camera installation being neglected
until the plane was supposedly entirely designed, and
even in production. At that stage the installation could be
but a makeshift. Only in the later stages of the war, when
plane design became a matter of coöperation between all
concerned, were fairly convenient and satisfactory arrangements
made for the camera. Always, however, the rapid succession
of new plane designs, with various shapes of fuselage
and details of structure, made camera installation in the
war plane a matter calling for the greatest ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The problem was met in part by constructing both
cameras and mountings in sections, to be laboriously wormed
in through inadequate apertures, in part by later structural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>changes in the planes, such as the substitution of veneer
rings or frames for the tension wires. In certain cases the
rear cockpit controls were omitted, thereby freeing accessible
and often adequate space for the larger cameras. Rear controls
were never used in the German planes, so that their
standard practice was to carry the camera forward of the
observer. This, together with the general restriction to the
13 × 18 centimeter size plate, made the installation problem
less difficult in the German aircraft than in the Allied.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Practical Solutions.</strong>—An important feature of camera
installation has already been mentioned, but may well be
repeated for emphasis. The camera and its anti-vibration
mounting should always be considered as a unit, and should
be so designed that simple bolts or straps will suffice to fasten
it in its place in the plane. Even should the spacing of the
structural parts of the plane not correspond to that anticipated
by the mounting design, the ingenuity of the man in
the field may be depended upon to make the necessary
alterations or additions to the plane. The design of the
camera suspension itself cannot, however, be left to uneducated
ingenuity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assuming the camera and mounting supplied, the next
step—a very difficult one—is to insure uniformity in the
structures to be built into the planes for the purpose of supporting
the camera mountings. With this uniformity must,
however, be combined the greatest possible flexibility to
provide for various designs of cameras.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the English service the standard camera installation
consists of wooden uprights with cross bars athwart the
plane, adjustable as to height (Fig. <a href='#fig_095'>95</a>). A distance between
the cross bars of 13¼ inches has been standardized, and all
camera cradles and mountings are notched or otherwise
spaced to fit this dimension. The installation adopted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>the American planes is similar, but with a distance of 16
inches between cross bars. These uprights and cross bars
are ordinarily situated in the bay behind the observer, but
can be placed in any available space. Fig. <a href='#fig_083'>83</a> shows, in a

<p class='c000'>A step in advance is made when the top tension wires
and superstructure are replaced by a rigid frame with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>opening large enough to admit the entire camera and mounting.
When this is done considerably larger cameras may be
accommodated in the same sized bay, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_096'>96</a>.
A further advance, from the standpoint of accessibility and
convenience of installation, follows when the tension wires
between observer's and camera bay are replaced by a ply-wood
ring, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_097'>97</a>. Here the only serious limitations
are those due to the vertical height of the camera,
and of course its weight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Openings for the lens to point through are simply provided
in the fabric covered aircraft, by cutting through the canvas
and stiffening the edge of the hole by wire. Tension wires
are often in the way. They may either be disregarded, since
they merely cut off a little light, or replaced in part by metal
rings, as shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_096'>96</a>. In veneer covered fuselages the
hole must of course go through the wood. This may be
undesirable, since the veneer is depended on to furnish
structural strength, a point which further emphasizes the
importance of the photographic requirements being thoroughly
considered while the plane is being designed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Single seater or scout planes do not lend themselves to
the insertion of such standardized uprights and cross-pieces,
because of their small size and the common utilization of all
space inside the fuselage for gasoline tanks and control
wires. Some French scouts, whose fuselages are very wide,
due to the rotary engines, have been fitted with compartments
for contemplated automatic film cameras. The most
commonly used camera in the single seater was, however, the
Italian 24-plate single-motion apparatus (Fig. <a href='#fig_049'>49</a>). This
camera and its carrying tray occupy very little lateral space
and have in actual practice been carried beneath the seat
or pushed up through an opening in the bottom of the fuselage
under the gasoline tank. Whatever criticism may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>made of the adequacy of the mounting, it must be said that
the camera, as used, is perhaps the most eminently practical
of all developed in the war, as its use on scouts testifies.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Special Photographic Planes.</strong>—As cameras grew in size,
the difficulty of installing them in planes built without regard
to photographic requirements greatly increased. Few planes
could carry even the 50 centimeter focus camera obliquely
without the necessity of poking its nose through the side
where it would catch wind and oil; while the 120 centimeter
camera could be carried obliquely only in the fore and aft
position. Even vertical installation of the latter camera was
really feasible in but few planes; sometimes the camera was
carried to the exclusion of the observer—and, in fact, this
size was never used by the English, whose fuselages were
small in cross-section.</p>

<p class='c000'>This situation led, late in the war, to steps toward producing
planes designed primarily for photographic reconnaissance.
In these the camera would be entirely accessible,
and cameras of any size could be carried in any desired
position. One scheme which properly belongs under this
heading was the provision of a special removable photographic
cockpit, for the front or nose of a twin-motored three
seater. Other noses, for bombing and heavy machine guns,
were also planned, all to be interchangeable. Since the
regular photographic bay with uprights and cross-pieces was
also provided to the rear, this special photographic ship
could on occasion do two classes of work, such as long focus
spotting and short focus mapping.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most completely worked out photographic plane was
probably the model designated P1 by the United States Air
Service. This is a modified DeHaviland 4 in which the rear
controls have been removed and the cowling raised and at the
same time made squarer in cross-section. The space formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>occupied by the rear controls provides ample room for all
types of camera. These are carried on uprights at the
standard distance apart, 16 inches, with cross-pieces adjustable
as to height. The camera space is accessible not only
from the observer's cockpit, but from above, upon folding
back the metal cover. Doors at the bottom and at each side
permit not only vertical but oblique exposures. The latter
are not interfered with by the wings, as they would be in
some designs of plane if the camera occupied the same position
relative to the cockpits. Fig. <a href='#fig_091'>91</a> shows the deRam
camera in place, as seen from the rear. Figs. <a href='#fig_098'>98</a> and <a href='#fig_099'>99</a> show
the 18 × 24 centimeter film camera, set both for vertical and
oblique views.</p>

<p class='c000'>Negative lenses are provided for both pilot and observer,
the one for the pilot permitting him to see from a point far
ahead to directly underneath, while the observer's is furnished
with cross wires below and etched rectangles of the
camera field sizes on the upper surface. Windows of non-breakable
glass assist in sighting obliques. The accompanying
picture (Fig. <a href='#fig_100'>100</a>) of the plane showing an oblique camera
in position gives an excellent idea of its appearance. Its
special features are worthy of copying in peace-time photographic
aircraft.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Installation of Auxiliaries.</strong>—It is quite necessary that
the camera lens be protected from splashing mud and often
from oil spray due to the motor. For this purpose an easily
opened and closed door is essential, unless the camera is
carried well up in the plane. An alternative, possessing
certain advantages, is to incorporate into the camera protecting
flaps operating in front of the lens, which open only
when the exposure is made. If the camera projects beyond
the fuselage, <em>stream lined hoods</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_095'>95</a>) must be provided to
protect the camera nose with the minimum of air resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The mounting of the regular camera auxiliaries—releases,
sights, propellers, speed controls, motors—is usually a great
bother, due to lack of space and to the severe restrictions on
methods of fastening. Screws in longerons or uprights are
taboo. Metal straps to go around structural parts are the
approved device, but with variations in the size of these
members, the holes, straps, bolts and nuts provided are very
apt not to fit. Changes of construction, such as that from
skeletons covered with fabric to veneer bodies, also interfere
with any standard means of attachment, and leave this, like
many other problems in war-time aerial photography, to
the resourcefulness of the man in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>Magazine racks must be tucked away in any available
space. Under the seat is a position frequently utilized.
Especially with plates is it desirable to carry the extra
magazines in a position to interfere as little as possible with
the balance of the plane. In the DH 4 this means that they
should be carried if possible forward of the observer, even
though he must turn completely around to get and insert
each magazine.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The general appearance of the earth as viewed from above
has already been described and illustrated (Figs. <a href='#fig_010'>10</a> and <a href='#fig_011'>11</a>).
It remains to deal with the earth's appearance in a more
analytic and quantitative manner, in order to decide upon
the characteristics to be sought in our photographic sensitive
materials.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Range of Brightness.</strong>—The absence of great contrasts
so apparent in the view of the earth from a plane is confirmed
by photometric observations. These show that the average
landscape, as seen from the air, rarely presents a range of
brightness of more than seven to one, even when seen without
the presence of veiling haze. It is to be remembered that
shadows constitute no important part of the aerial landscape.
Vertical walls in shadow, which form a substantial part of
the surfaces seen by an observer on the ground, are invisible
or greatly foreshortened from the air. Moreover, they are
never contrasted against the sky, which is photographically
often the brightest part of the ordinary picture. To the
aviator's eye shadows on the ground are only of any length
at early and late daylight hours. Even at these times they
cover but a small area, since the number of high vertically
projecting objects in a representative landscape is small.
Lacking shadows, the brightness range is only that between
various kinds of earth, water, and vegetation. Chalk (from
freshly dug trenches), reflected sunlight from water, or
marble buildings, furnish almost the only extensions to the
brightness scale as above given.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span><em>Diurnal and seasonal changes.</em> During the winter
months on the Western Front photography from the air
was only possible for two or three hours around noon, on
clear days. This calls attention to another factor of prime
importance, namely, the large variation in the intensity of
daylight during the course of the day and during the course
of the year.</p>

<div id='fig_101'  class='figcenter id041'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 101.</span>—Variation of average daylight intensity during the day.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Measurements showing typical variations from morning
to night are exhibited in Fig. <a href='#fig_101'>101</a>, from which it appears
that there is an increase in illumination of four to five times
from 8 o'clock—when it would be considered full daylight
for purely visual observation—until noon, while there is a
corresponding decrease by four o'clock. Fig. <a href='#fig_102'>102</a> shows sets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>of measurements by two different authorities which give
the average intensity of daylight for each month throughout
the year. From December to July there is an increase of
approximately ten times. From both sets of data it therefore
appears that—neglecting the frequent occurrence of
clouds which reduce the illumination to a half or a quarter
or even less—a variation in illumination of forty or fifty
times occurs between mid-day in summer and morning in
winter. In the photography of stationary objects on the
ground this range of intensities is easily taken care of by
selection of lens stop and shutter speed. On the airplane
it is quite otherwise, because the shutter speeds called for
at the lower illuminations are much slower than the motion
of the plane will allow.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 102.</span>—Variation of intensity of daylight through the year; two different sets of measurements.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Haze.</strong>—At low altitudes the brightness range is substantially
that which would be obtained by photometric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>measurements of soil and vegetation made at the earth's
surface. At higher altitudes, especially above 2000 meters,
this brightness range is materially decreased by atmospheric
haze. The significance of this lies in the fact that for safety
from anti-aircraft guns, war-time aerial photography must
be carried out at very great elevations. Toward the end of
the Great War photographic missions traveling at from 5000
to 7000 meters were the rule. At these heights, even in very
clear weather, a veil of bluish-white haze reduces the already
small contrasts still more. Some means for overcoming the
effect of this haze becomes imperative, therefore, in order
to secure in the picture even the normal contrast of the object.</p>

<p class='c000'>Haze is to be sharply distinguished from clouds or fog.
Clouds and fog consist of globules of water vapor of large
size, opaque to light. Haze, on the contrary, is more opaque
to some colors than to others, or is <em>selective</em> in its veiling
effect. Its scattering action on light is greatest in the violet
and blue of the spectrum, decreasing rapidly through the
green, yellow, and red, the exact relation being that the
scattering is inversely as the fourth power of the wave-length.
It is, consequently, possible to pierce or cut haze by
using yellow, orange, or red color screens. It is this possibility
which has led to the extensive use of yellow or orange
goggles for shooting and for naval lookout work. In aerial
photography the equivalent is to be found in <em>color filters</em>,
used with color sensitive (orthochromatic or panchromatic)
plates, which have been found essential for all high altitude
work.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Color.</strong>—Visual observation from the airplane is aided in
no inconsiderable degree by the differences of <em>color</em> that exist
between various objects of nearly the same brightness. This
means of distinguishing differences of character fails in the
photographic plate, which is color-blind; that is, it reproduces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>all objects as grays of varying brightness. It is color-blind
in another sense as well, in that it evaluates colors as to
brightness differently from the way the eye does, overrating
blues and violets and underrating yellows and reds. This
first kind of color-blindness is a positive disadvantage, for it
leaves available for differentiating objects only their brightness
differences. The second kind of color-blindness may on
occasion actually be an advantage. For it may happen by
accident, or by design (through the skilful use of color filters),
that objects appearing nearly the same to the eye appear
different in the plate. More will be said about this in connection
with the use of filters for the detection of camouflage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The range of hues seen in the aerial landscape is not
large. Greens (grass and foliage) predominate, followed by
browns (earth), neither color being bright or saturated. Over
towns or cities we find that grays (roads) and redder browns
(brick) are conspicuous. Blues are practically never seen,
although it is to be noted that a fair share of the illumination
of the ground is by blue sky light and that the haze itself is
bluish. Consequently, the general tone of a landscape is
much bluer than one would be apt to imagine it from consideration
of the general green and brown character of the
constituent objects. A color photograph from the air would
greatly resemble a pastel in its low range of tones and the
absence of bright colors.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Photographic Requirements Dictated by Brightness
and Color Considerations.</strong>—Considering only the demands
made by the character of the view presented to the airplane
camera, and leaving out of account other limitations to
photographic operations in the plane, certain requirements
as to sensitized materials may be outlined. First of all, the
photographic process must not reduce, but should rather be
capable of exaggerating, the range of brightness of the object.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Preferably the seven-to-one range of the object photographed
should be lengthened out to the full range of the printing
paper, which may be two to three times this. With such an
increase of range, those minute differences of brightness are
accentuated, on which the detection of many objects depends.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next, the plate or film must be sensitive to the portion of
the spectrum transmitted by a yellow or orange filter which
will cut out the effect of haze. This calls for orthochromatic
or panchromatic plates, depending on the depth of filter
required. Next, if the objects to be photographed differ
little in brightness but are different in color composition,
we may have to rely on color filters of peculiar transmissions,
capable of translating these color differences into brightness
differences. These will, in general, call for fully color sensitive,
or panchromatic plates.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conclusion it may be pointed out that the endeavor in
ordinary orthochromatic photography—to reproduce the
visual brightness of colors in the photographic print—has no
real justification in aerial work. Neither in respect to color
values nor in respect to brightness range is it the object of
aerial photography, especially for war purposes, to present a
truthful tone reproduction. Its aim is rather the adequate
differentiation of detail, by whatever means necessary.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <span class='large'>CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC EMULSIONS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The purely photographic problem in aerial photography,
as distinct from the instrumental one, is the selection of
photo sensitive materials which will yield useful results under
the conditions peculiar to exposure from the air. After such
materials have been found by extensive field tests, it is preeminently
desirable to determine their characteristics in such
terms that the kind of plate or film may thereafter be specified
and selected on the basis of purely laboratory tests.
Specification must be made in terms of the ordinary sensitometric
constants of the photographic emulsion—its speed,
contrast, fog, development factor, its color sensitiveness, its
ability to render fine detail, and its grosser physical properties
such as hardness and shrinkage.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sensitometry.</strong>—The most generally used system of
sensitometry is that of Hurter and Driffield, commonly
referred to as the “H &amp; D.” By this system, in order to
determine the characteristics of a given photographic plate,
it is necessary to take a series of graduated exposures, a
standard illumination of the plate being varied in known
amount by a rapidly rotating disc cut to a series of different
openings, or by some other suitable means. The negative
thus obtained is developed in a standard developer for a
definite time, at a fixed temperature, and is then measured
for transmission on a photometer. The following terms are
defined and used in plotting the results:</p>

<p class='c000'>Hurter and Driffield pointed out that a negative would
give a true representation of the differences in the light and
shade of the object if it reproduced these differences by
equivalent differences in opacity. This is equivalent to
stating that if the densities are plotted against the logarithms
of the corresponding exposures, a straight line should be
obtained at 45 degrees to the axis of exposure times. If the
line is at another angle the opacities of the negative will be
<em>proportional</em> to the brightness of the object photographed,
but the <em>contrast</em> will be different.</p>

<p class='c000'>A typical H &amp; D plot is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_103'>103</a>. It will be
noted that two curves are shown. These are obtained with
different developments, and illustrate the fact that the contrast
or proportionality between exposure differences and
opacity differences is a matter of time of development. Each
of these curves exhibits certain characteristics which are
common to all made in this way. There is primarily a
<em>straight line portion</em>, where opacities are proportional to
illumination. This is commonly called the region of <em>correct
exposure</em>. The slope of this straight line portion—the ratio of
<span class='overunder'>density<br /><span class='ov'>log exposure</span></span>—is the <em>development factor</em>, commonly denoted
by “<span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span>,” a gamma of unity denoting exact tone rendering.
Below the region of correct exposure is a “toe,” or region of
smaller contrast, called the region of <em>under exposure</em>. Above
the correct exposure region is another where the opacity
approaches constancy (afterwards decreasing or “reversing”),
called the region of <em>over exposure</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>speed</em> of a plate on the H &amp; D scale is given by the
intersection of the straight line portion of the characteristic
curve when produced, with the exposure axis. This intersection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>point, called the <em>inertia</em>, is the same irrespective of
the time of development, as is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_103'>103</a>. The numerical
value of the speed is obtained by dividing 34 by the inertia,
when the exposure is plotted in candle-meter-seconds.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a plate is developed until no more density and contrast
can be obtained, its development factor is then <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span><sub>∞</sub>, (gamma
infinity), and the larger this is the more a plate can be forced
in development. If the plate fogs in its unexposed portions
this fog is measured and recorded in density units along with
the other constants. The speed of development is represented
by the <em>velocity constant</em>, commonly symbolized by <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">κ</span>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The length of the straight line portion determines the
<em>latitude</em> of the plate, or the range of permissible exposures to
secure a “perfect negative.” Thus if we assume that an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>object has a range of brightness of 1 to 30, then a plate with
a straight line characteristic extending over a range of 1 to 120
would have a latitude of <span class='overunder'><span class='under'>120</span><br />30</span> or 4. That is, the exposure could
be as much as four times the necessary one, and still give the
same result on a sufficiently exposed print. If the latitude of the
plate is too small, the shadows will fall in the under exposure region,
the high-lights in the over exposure portion of the characteristic
curve, with consequent poor rendering of contrasts.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Criteria of Speed.</strong>—In airplane photography <em>speed</em> is of
paramount importance, but great care must be exercised to
insure that all the factors are considered which can contribute
toward yielding the desirable pictorial quality in the brief
exposure which alone is possible from the moving plane. A
“fast” plate on the H &amp; D scale is not necessarily suitable
for aerial work, when we remember that accentuation of
natural contrast is desirable, particularly under hazy conditions.
For, as is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_104'>104</a>, it is a common characteristic
of “fast” plates to have comparatively small latitude
and low contrast at their maximum development.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is to be noted that the Hurter and Driffield measure of
speed is bound up with the idea of correct tone rendering and
with the use of the straight line portion of the characteristic
curve. Other criteria of speed exist. For instance, the exposure
necessary to produce a just noticeable action (threshold
value); and the exposure necessary to give a chosen useful
density in the high-lights when development is pushed to the
limit set by the growth of fog.</p>

<p class='c000'>As has already been pointed out, correct tone rendering
is not necessary or even indicated as desirable in aerial views.
It is, moreover, a matter of experience that the majority of
aerial exposures with existing plates fall in the “under
exposure” period, where contrasts with normal development
are less than in the subject. This being the case, the problem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>is to select not necessarily a fast plate, by the H &amp; D criterion,
but a plate which will develop up workable densities in the
under exposure region. A plate of medium speed will sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>develop to greater densities in the short exposure
region, if development is forced, than will a fast plate. The
contrast in the normal exposure region will be excessive, but
this is of no significance if no exposure falling in this region
is present on the plate.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 104.</span>—Characteristic curves of fast and slow plates, developed to maximum contrast.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In addition to its capacity for developing density, the
plate should have as low a threshold as possible, thus meeting
to some extent the requirements of both the alternative
criteria of speed given above. At the same time it is true
that low threshold and good density for short exposures
are not to be found in really slow plates. Consequently,
while high speed, as ordinarily understood, is undoubtedly
the first requirement, we may expect the complete specification
for the best aerial plate to be a rather complicated thing,
describing the characteristics of a workable “toe” of the
curve, in terms of which several (<em>e.g.</em>, contrast and speed) are
derived from another and quite different exposure region.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Effect of Temperature on Plate Speed.</strong>—It has been found
by Abney and Dewar that very low temperatures materially
decrease the speed of photographic emulsions. This decrease
may amount to as much as 50 per cent. in the temperature
range from 30 degrees Centigrade above zero to 30 degrees
below zero, which is the range over which aerial photographic
operations will have to be carried on in war-time. This
effect has not been at all fully studied, and it is not known
whether it is general or only found in certain kinds of plates.
The remedy indicated is to provide means for heating the
plates or films when low temperatures are encountered. This
is fairly easy in film cameras, or in plate cameras like the
deRam, where the entire load of plates is carried in the
camera body. Plates carried in magazines present a more
difficult problem. The heating coil incorporated in the
German cameras is perhaps partly for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span><strong>Color Sensitiveness.</strong>—Complete specifications for an
aerial plate cannot be made solely on the basis of its speed,
contrast, latitude, threshold, and other sensitometric values
which have to do only with the intensity of the light acting
on it. These in general apply to photography from low altitudes,
where the illumination and natural contrast of the
subject are the only factors to consider. When higher altitudes
are reached the interposition of haze decreases the
already deficient contrast, calling either for the development
of more contrast in the plate, or for the use of color filters
to cut out the action of the blue and violet light predominant
in haze. Along the lines discussed in the last section, it is
not surprising to find that some plates are better than others
for bringing out gradations masked by haze, even though no
filters are used and though the plates are similar in color
sensitiveness. But the limitations to securing contrast by
manipulating the characteristic curve of the plate are soon
reached, and it becomes necessary to resort to haze-piercing
color filters, used with <em>color sensitive</em> plates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roughly, two general types of color sensitive emulsions
may be distinguished: first, those in which sensitiveness to
green and yellow is added to the natural blue sensitiveness,
and second, those sensitive in a useful degree to all colors of
the spectrum. The former are called <em>iso-</em> or <em>ortho-chromatic</em>,
the latter <em>panchromatic</em> emulsions. Spectrograms exhibiting
the distribution of sensitiveness throughout the spectrum
for several representative plates are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_105'>105</a>.
Orthochromatic plates are adequate for use with light yellow
filters and have the slight practical working advantage that
they can be handled by red light. Panchromatic plates are
necessary for use with dark orange or red filters. They must
be handled in total darkness or in an exceedingly faint blue-green
light, taking advantage of the common drop in sensibility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>in that region of the spectrum. Plates can, indeed, be
sensitized for the red alone, leaving a gap of almost complete
insensibility in the green, as shown in the fourth spectrogram
of Fig. <a href='#fig_105'>105</a>. When used with a yellow filter these plates
behave as do panchromatic plates with a red filter.</p>

<div id='fig_105'  class='figcenter id043'>
<img src='images/fig_105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 105.</span>—Spectrograms of representative photographic plates: <em>a</em>, ordinary plate; <em>b</em>, orthochromatic plate; <em>c</em>, specially green-sensitive plate; <em>d</em>, red sensitive plate, insensitive to green; <em>e</em>, panchromatic plate; <em>f</em>, specially red-sensitive panchromatic plate.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A rougher idea of color sensitiveness than is given by
spectrograms is furnished by the <em>tri-color ratio</em>, which is the
ratio of exposure times necessary with white light to give
equal photographic action through a certain set of red, green
and blue filters, expressed in terms of the blue exposure as
unity. In an excellent panchromatic plate the three exposures
would be equal. In an orthochromatic plate the red
exposure will be too large to be figured. In interpreting either
spectrograms or tri-color ratios care must be taken that the
<em>absolute</em> exposures necessary are known. Thus a relatively
high red sensitiveness may mean merely low absolute
blue sensitiveness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two methods are used in imparting color sensitiveness.
Either the sensitizing dye is incorporated in the plate emulsion
before it is flowed; or the plate is bathed in a dye
solution not long before using. The latter method gives
higher color sensitiveness but poorer keeping quality, and
is not a practical method for field operations. Greatly
enhanced sensibility may be given by treatment with ammonia,
but this again is a method for laboratory rather
than field use.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Resolving Power.</strong>—A question which arises in connection
with all photography of detail is the size of the grain of the
photographic emulsion. Dependent on the size of the grain
is the <em>resolving power</em>, or ability to separate images of closely
adjacent objects. This varies with the speed, fast plates
being of coarser grain than slow ones; with the exposure; and
with the method and time of development. In general, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>may be said that the resolving power of the plate does not
enter practically into aerial work, because the resolving
power of all plates so far found usable corresponds to a
smaller distance than the size of a point image as limited by
the performance of the camera lens and the speed of the
plane. Remembering that ⅒ mm. is a fair value for the
size of a point image as rendered by the lens, the rôle of plate-resolving
power is shown by consideration of the following
table. Resolving powers are given in terms of lines to the
millimeter just separable.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Tabulation of Requirements for Aerial Emulsions.</strong>—In
terms of the sensitometric quantities just discussed the
general requirements for aerial plates may be listed as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. <em>Speed.</em> The speed usually connected with the contrast
and density required for the exposure times available is
about 150 H &amp; D. Faster plates in general have too low
contrast, but the highest speed that will give the necessary
contrast is desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. <em>Contrast.</em> The contrast capable of development without
fog should be from 1.5 to 2. This contrast should be
produced by light of daylight quality, and, in orthochromatic
and panchromatic plates, with the yellow or orange filters
intended to be used with them. This contrast means a
gamma infinity approaching 2.5.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <em>Speed of development.</em> A gamma of nearly 2 should be
developed in 2½ minutes at 20 degrees C. in the developers
recommended below.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>4. <em>Fog.</em> Not over .25 for this degree of development, and
not over .40 for six minutes development.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. <em>Color sensitiveness.</em> This should in general be as high
as possible. In terms of certain representative filters (described
in a subsequent chapter) color sensitiveness should
be such that with the white light speed above specified the
relative exposures through the filters shall not be greater
than as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Relative Behavior of Plates and Films.</strong>—The advantages
of film from the standpoint of weight and bulk have been
discussed in connection with aerial cameras. Were there no
other considerations film would unquestionably be the most
appropriate medium for aerial photography. There is, however,
the question of ease of handling, to be treated in a
subsequent chapter, and the question whether the purely
photographic characteristics of film are satisfactory. Can
the same speed, contrast, and color sensitiveness be obtained
on film as on glass? Is the picture so obtained as permanent
or reliable as the plate image?</p>

<p class='c000'>It must be confessed that up to the present emulsions
on film have not proved the equal of those on glass. It has
been found by emulsion manufacturers that the same emulsion
flowed on film and on glass gives better quality on the
glass. Emulsions specially prepared for film fall somewhat
short of the best plate emulsions. It has also been found
harder to color-sensitize film, and to insure good keeping
quality in the color sensitized product.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the question of photographic quality there
arises the matter of shrinkage and distortion. These are
negligible with plates, but are a more or less unknown quantity
in film. Irregular shrinkages of as much as two per cent.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>are found on experiment. This defect, of course, would be an
obstacle only in exact mapping work.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Positype Paper.</strong>—The need sometimes arises in military
operations to secure prints ready for examination within a
few minutes after the receipt of the negatives. Even the
15 or 20 minutes within which a negative can be developed
and a wet print taken may be considered too long. While
such occasions are probably more apt to occur in popular
magazine stories than in actual warfare, it is important to
have available methods of producing prints with an absolute
minimum of delay. This need is met to some degree by a
direct print process, commercially exploited under the name
of “Positype.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In this process the exposure is made directly on a sensitized
paper or card, which is developed, the image dissolved
out, the residue exposed, and again developed; thus furnishing
a positive picture (reversed right and left). The time
necessary to develop a print ready for examination need
not be more than three minutes. Only a single print is
available, but this is all that would be called for under the
extreme conditions suggested. If later, copies are desired
they may be made by the same process.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plates and Films Found Satisfactory for Aerial Work.</strong>—The
following plates and films have been found particularly
good for aerial photography. The list is not intended to be
complete. Furthermore, it may be expected to be soon superseded,
as the efforts of various manufacturers are directed
toward developing special aerial photographic plates.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>The Function of Filters in Aerial Photography.</strong>—The use
of color screens or filters has been very common in ordinary
landscape photography, for the purpose of securing approximately
correct renderings of the brightnesses of colored
objects. Plates of the non-color-sensitive type have their
maximum of sensitiveness in the blue of the spectrum (Fig.
<a href='#fig_105'>105</a>) and in consequence blue skies photograph as white,
while other colors are likewise reproduced on a totally wrong
scale. Filters for correct brightness rendering are calculated
for a given color sensitive plate so that the resultant reaction
to the light of the spectrum copies the sensitiveness of the
eye, which is greatest in the yellow-green. Such filters for
use with the common orthochromatic plates are of a general
yellow color.</p>

<p class='c000'>Filters for aerial work are meant to serve quite a different
purpose. Correct tone or color rendering is of quite secondary
importance to another use of filters, namely, to cut or
pierce aerial haze. It is quite a matter of accident that the
same general color of filter is called for both to give correct
color rendering and to pierce aerial haze, namely, <em>yellow</em>. Yet
on closer analysis it is found that quite different types of
yellow filter are demanded, spectroscopically considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Figure 106 (K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub>) shows the spectral transmission
curves of the Wratten K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>2</sub> filters, intended for correct
color rendering with orthochromatic plates. The absorption
increases <em>gradually</em> toward the blue. In the same figure is
shown on an arbitrary scale the spectroscopic character of
typical haze illumination, increasing in brightness inversely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>as the fourth power of the wave-length, that is, with great
rapidity in the blue and violet. It is evident from this that
a much more abrupt absorption than that of the K<sub>1</sub> or K<sub>2</sub>
filter is desirable, because in the green of the spectrum the
haze light is comparatively weak, and more will be lost by
any absorption in this region through decreasing useful
photographic action than will be gained by cutting out the
haze. This latter consideration is important. The use of
any filter means an increase of exposure; the use of yellow
filters multiplies it several times. Careful experiment has
shown that no filter of depth less than K 1½, to use the Wratten
filters as a basis for discussion, are of real value in haze
piercing. The <em>filter ratio</em>, or ratio of exposures with and
without filter, is 4.7 for the K 1½ with the Cramer Isonon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>plate—a figure which shows the importance of securing the
necessary haze-piercing character with the minimum absorption
of useful photographic light.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 106.</span>—Characteristics of various filters.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Practical Filters.</strong>—Since the character of the absorption
of the “K” filters is not all that could be desired, new filters,
both of dyed gelatin and of glass, have been produced. The
glass, a Corning product having a very sharp-cut absorption,
has not yet been produced on a commercial scale with the
high transparency in green, yellow and red that selected
samples have shown. The United States Air Service has
adopted filters of a new dye, called the EK, from the name
of the company in whose laboratory it was produced. These
filters are standardized in two depths of staining, called the
“Aero No. 1” and “Aero No. 2.” Their spectral transmission
curves appear in Fig. <a href='#fig_106'>106</a>, along with those of certain
darker filters useful only with panchromatic plates for
exceptionally heavy haze. The characteristic of these Aero
filters is their great transparency through all the spectrum
except the blue, whereby the greatest haze-cutting action is
attained together with a low filter factor. The filter factors
of the Aero No. 1 and No. 2 with Cramer Isonon plates are
3 and 5, respectively.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Effects Secured by the Use of Filters.</strong>—The efficiency of
yellow filters for haze-cutting is best shown by photographs
taken at high altitudes with filters and without. Such illustrations
are given in Figs. <a href='#fig_107'>107</a> and <a href='#fig_108'>108</a>, where the first photograph
is one taken at 10,000 feet without a filter, the second taken
at the same altitude under the same conditions, but with
an orange filter. Both are on panchromatic plates, and it
will be seen that even with these plates the filter makes all
the difference between a useless and a useful picture. But
it must be clearly understood that the difference here lies
between a plate sensitive chiefly in the blue and violet, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>a plate affected only by the yellow, orange and red. The
difference is not between what the eye sees and what a plate
with a filter sees, as is sometimes supposed. As shown in
Fig. <a href='#fig_108'>108</a>, a filter enables the plate to photograph through the
haze between clouds, but not through the clouds themselves.
In general, no filter and plate combination which is feasible
for aerial exposures is capable of showing more than the eye
can see if yellow or orange goggles are worn. To do this it
would be necessary for the photographic action to take place
by deep red or infra-red light, which would demand exposures
now out of the question.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>that filters may be dispensed with. Clearing weather was

<p class='c000'><strong>Filters for the Photographic Detection of Camouflage.</strong>—In
the photographic as in the visual detection of camouflage,
the problem is to differentiate colors which ordinarily look
alike, but which are actually of different color composition.
Particularly important are the differences between natural
foliage greens and the paints used to simulate them. If these
differ in their reflection spectra, a proper choice of filter will
show up the two greens as markedly different. Two kinds
of difference may be produced; either the two colors may be
changed in relative brightness, or they may be altered in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>hue. Thus foliage green, due to its possessing a reflection
band in the red of the spectrum, which is absent in most
pigments, may be made to appear <em>red</em> while the camouflage
remains green or turns black. Filters which cause changes
of color are of course of no use for photographic detection
of camouflage, since the photographic image is colorless.
Brightness differences are alone available.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those same filters which have been worked out primarily
for producing brightness differences in visual detection of
camouflage could be used photographically, provided the
plates employed were color sensitive, and were as well
screened to imitate the sensibility of the eye. But the most
useful visual filters are those causing color differences to
appear; more than this, the visual camouflage detection filters
as a class have low light transmissions, so that their usefulness
in photography is doubtful. Little work has actually
been done with camouflage detection filters for photography.
Yet in spite of this photography has been of real service in
this form of detective work. Its utility for the purpose comes
from the fact that the natural sensitiveness of the plate to blue,
violet and invisible ultra-violet acts to extend the range of
the spectrum in which differences between identical and
merely visually matched colors may be picked up. Consequently
the plain unscreened plate has proved a very efficient
camouflage detector—so efficient in fact that all camouflage
materials have had to be subjected to a photographic
test before acceptance. Fig. <a href='#fig_171'>171</a> shows how an ordinary
photograph reveals the unnatural character of the camouflage
over a battery.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Methods of Mounting and Using Filters.</strong>—The most primitive
way of mounting a gelatin filter is to cut a disc from a
sheet of dyed gelatin and insert it between the components of
the lens. For this purpose the gelatin must be perfectly flat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>which is insured by its method of preparation and test. One
disadvantage of this method is that the filter can be inserted
and removed only upon the ground. It is less satisfactory
the larger the diameter of the lens, and the wastage of filters
due to insertion and removal is apt to be high. The camera
should be refocussed after filters of this kind are inserted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glass filters, ground optically true, or gelatin filters,
mounted between optically flat glass plates, are the most
convenient and satisfactory. They may be mounted in
circular cells to screw or attach by bayonet catches to the
front of the lens. Or they may be mounted in rectangular
frames to slide into transverse grooves in the camera body.
Fig. <a href='#fig_044'>44</a> shows the mount of this latter form adopted in the
larger United States Air Service cameras. This is particularly
convenient if it is desired to insert or change the
filter while in the air—a practice not generally considered
feasible in war work with the photographically inexperienced
observer, but likely to be common with the employment of
skilled photographers for peace-time aerial photography.</p>

<p class='c000'>German cameras are reported in which the glass filter is
carried behind the lens, on a lever which also carries a clear
glass plate of the same thickness, to be thrown in when no
filter is needed, thus maintaining the focus. The performance
of the lens will be impaired by this scheme, unless it is
specially calculated to offset the effect of the glass introduced
in the path of the rays behind the lens—optically true glass
has no effect on definition if placed in front of the lens. Glass
filters may also be placed in close contact with the plate
or film, in which case they must be much larger, but do not
need to be of as good optical quality.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Self-screening Plates.</strong>—Mention must be made of a
quite different mode of realizing the filter idea, a method
available where the sensitive plate is always to be used with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>a filter. This is to incorporate a yellow dye in the gelatin
of the plate itself. The dye must be one which has no direct
chemical effect on the plate, but which acts simply as a
coloring agent for the gelatin. “Self-screening” plates, as
they are called, have been produced by the use of the dye
called “filter yellow” and have found some use in orthochromatic
photography. They effect a useful saving of light
through the elimination of the reflection losses at the surfaces
of glass and gelatin filters. The filtering action of the
dye in the plate is somewhat different from its ordinary
one, since the deeper portions of the sensitive film are subject
to greater action than the surface, and this tends to
diminish contrast.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <span class='large'>EXPOSURE OF AERIAL NEGATIVES</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The principal factors governing the length of exposure in
the airplane camera have already been discussed under
various headings. These are briefly, the nature of the aerial
landscape, the practically attainable lens apertures, the
form of the camera support, the speed of the plane, and the
characteristics of plates, films and filters. It is convenient
however, to re-assemble this information in one place, in
such form as to apply to the practical problem of determining
the exposure to be given in any specific case.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Limitations to Exposure.</strong>—In the ordinary photography
of stationary objects, exposure is a variable entirely at the
operator's command. Plates of any speed may be selected,
so that attention may be focussed on latitude, color sensitiveness,
and other tone rendering characteristics. The
exposure may be made of a length sufficient to insure all the
useful photographic action lying in the “correct exposure”
portion of the sensitometric curve. The exposure ratio of
any filter it is desired to use is a matter of indifference—its
effect on color rendering need alone be considered.</p>

<p class='c000'>Airplane photography is sharply distinguished from
ground “still” photography by its severe limitations as to
the amount of the exposure. The actual duration is definitely
restricted by the high speed of the plane. In peace
work this can be offset in part by using slower planes or by
flying against the wind. The practical limitation to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span>
second, set by war-time requirements as to definition of fine
detail, may be increased to <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>50</span></span> of a second, or even more,
where mapping of grosser features is the object. A common,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>but entirely avoidable limitation, is that due to vibration
of the camera. By proper mounting this may be entirely
overcome, leaving the ground speed of the plane the only
source of exposure-limiting movement. The amount of light
reaching the plate constitutes a primary factor in exposure,
and this is a matter of lens aperture. Generally, lens aperture
is smaller the larger the plate required to be covered, and the
greater the focal length. Because of their larger aperture,
the short-focus lenses which will be favored for peace-time
large-area mapping will permit more and longer working
days than have been the rule in long-focus war photography.
The necessary use of filters, particularly at the high altitudes
which would be chosen in mapping, in order to economize
in the number of flights needed to cover a given area, introduces
an inevitable decrease in the amount of light available
at the plate, as compared with surface photography under
the same illuminations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Broadly speaking, it may be said that all the demands
made in reference to aerial photographic exposure work are to
<em>decrease</em> the amount of light reaching the plate. Any surplus
offered, as by the midsummer noon-day sun, must be immediately
snapped up, either by decreasing the exposure to get
greater sharpness, or by introducing filters to get greater
photographic contrast. The absolute exposure of the plate
tends to be kept at the irreducible minimum. As already
stated, it lies, with present photographic materials, on the
“toe” of the “H &amp; D” curve, just reaching up into the
straight line portion.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Estimation of Exposure.</strong>—According to the foregoing
argument the problem of estimating an aerial exposure
resolves itself largely into one of deciding how short this
may be made. Or, if the light is strong, whether it is sufficient
so that a filter may be introduced without demanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>more than the <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> second or thereabouts which is dictated
by the motion of the plane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deciding upon exposures in the field has been largely
a matter of experience and judgment. A majority of the
cameras in use during the war were not furnished with shutters
calibrated in definite speeds. Consequently, the sergeant
upon whom the decision usually devolved became a storehouse
of knowledge as to the slit widths and tensions appropriate
to each individual camera. This knowledge had to
be acquired from the results of actual photographic reconnaissances,
or from special test flights, both of them wasteful
methods. But the chief objection to this state of affairs
lies in the fact that the knowledge thus acquired is of no use
to anyone else, nor is it applicable to other types of camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first essential to placing exposure estimation upon a
sound basis is therefore an accurate knowledge of shutter
performances. Either the shutter speeds should be placed
upon the camera by the manufacturer and periodically
checked, or a regular practice should be followed of calibrating
shutters, either at a base laboratory or even in the field.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assuming that the speeds of all shutters are accurately
known, the process of estimating the requisite exposure
becomes less a matter of mere guesswork and more nearly
a matter of precision. For this purpose data on the variation
of light intensity during the day and during the year (Figs.
<a href='#fig_101'>101</a> and <a href='#fig_102'>102</a>) should be taken as a guide. These data refer
of course to visual and not to photographic light, but since
it is always necessary to use color filters, which make the
active light of approximately visual quality, this is no valid
objection. The effects of clouds and mist must of course be
learned largely by experience, but with the above daylight
data at hand, anyone in possession of definite information
on the correct exposure with a given plate for a known day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>and hour need not go far wrong in estimating exposures at
any other time in definite fractions of a second.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><em>Exposure data charts.</em> Fig. <a href='#fig_109'>109</a> shows a chart, prepared
in the French service, indicating aerial exposures for
all hours of the day throughout the year. These are for clear
sunlight, for a lens of aperture F/5.6 and for “ortho” plates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>without a filter. They are based on what is probably an
over-estimate of the actual speeds given by the French
shutters. For “light” clouds the exposures are to be
doubled, for “heavy” clouds quadrupled, and for forests
and dark ground “lengthened.” Charts of this form should
be extremely useful, but they were actually not of great
service because of the prevalent lack of knowledge of true
shutter speeds.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Exposure meters.</em> Aerial photography offers an excellent
opportunity for the use of exposure meters, particularly
those of the type in which a sensitive surface is exposed to
the light for a measured time sufficient to darken a predetermined
amount. The sensitive paper of the meter may
either be exposed from the ground to the direct light of sun
and sky, or from the plane to the light reflected from the
ground. The first method will give figures subject to some
correction for the character of the ground to be photographed—whether
fields, forests, or snow. The second
method is to be preferred where the shutter speed can be
adjusted in the air, according to the indications of the
meter, or where the filter can be selected and put in place
during flight. Trials with a commercial Wynne exposure
meter, used in the latter manner, give as a working figure an
exposure of .001 second for each 4½ seconds taken to darken
the sensitometer strip to match the darker comparison
patch. This relation applies to a lens of aperture F/4.5, on
Cramer Commercial Isonon plates without filter.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <span class='large'>PRINTING MEDIA</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Skilled photographers can examine a negative and can
interpret its renderings with practically as much satisfaction
as they get from a print, whereby a considerable amount of
time can be saved in an emergency. The original glass
negative should always be used when accurate measurements
are to be made. These and a few other cases constitute the
only use of a negative apart from its normal one, namely,
for producing positive prints, usually in large numbers. The
commonest form of print is on paper, although the most
satisfactory print from the photographic standpoint is the
transparency on glass or celluloid film.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Transparencies.</strong>—Transparencies are made by the regular
photographic processes of exposure and development, on
glass plates or films placed in contact with the negative, or
in the appropriate position in an enlarging camera. The
sensitometry and the terms used to describe the qualities
of plate or film for this purpose are those already given in
connection with the general discussion of plates and films.
But the kind of emulsion to be selected is quite different
from the aerial negative emulsion. There is here no practical
limitation to the speed, contrast or latitude. Consequently,
we can choose a positive emulsion on which the exposure
through the aerial negative falls entirely on the straight line
portion of the characteristic curve, thus reproducing all of
its tones, and the contrast of the negative may be increased
to any desired extent. The possibilities of positive emulsion
are indeed rather greater than the usual aerial negative can
utilize. A range of clearly graduated opacities of two or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>three hundred to one is possible, so that not only can detail
be well rendered in the high-lights, but also equally well in
dark shadows where, indeed, an increase of illumination is
necessary for it to be made easy to examine. This range is
to be contrasted with the 1-to-7 range in the aerial landscape,
which may be doubled by a contrasty plate. In resolving
power, the positive emulsion, which is slow, exceeds the
negative emulsion. It easily bears examination through a
magnifying glass, thus making any enlargement unnecessary
in the printing process.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glass transparencies are of course impractical for general
distribution, on account of their fragility. Heavy film transparencies
are not open to this objection, and, especially in
the form of stereos, constitute the most beautiful form of
aerial photographic print.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Paper Prints.</strong>—Prints on paper suffer by comparison
with transparencies, in the range of tones which they exhibit.
This lies between the white of the paper, which never has
more than 80 per cent. reflecting power, and its darkest
black, which differs with the kind of paper. In dull or mat
papers the blacks will reflect as much as 5 per cent.; in glossy
papers, ordinarily used for aerial negatives, the reflection
from the black may be as low as one per cent., but in order
to get the benefit of this the paper must be so held as not to
reflect any bright object to the eyes. This deficiency in the
range of paper gradations is not so serious with aerial negatives
as with ordinary properly exposed negatives because
of the small range of brightness in the aerial view.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sensitometry of papers is similar to that of plates, with
the difference that reflecting powers take the place of transparency.
As in the case of transparency emulsions there is
in papers no dominating requirement for extreme speed, to
which other characteristics must be subordinated. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>speed is of sufficient importance in handling large quantities
of prints so that aerial negative printing for military purposes
has been done almost entirely on the rapid enlarging papers,
rather than on the true contact printing papers, which
are slower.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 110.</span>—Characteristic curves of bromide paper.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The two principal types of rapid enlarging papers, the
bromide and the “gas light,” exhibit certain characteristic
differences which are important to bear in mind in seeking
to obtain any particular quality of print. Bromide papers,
of which “Nikko” is a good example, show sensitometric
curves rather like those of plates. That is, they increase in
contrast with continued development. At the same time,
as is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_110'>110</a>, they increase somewhat in speed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>with development; that is, under exposure can be compensated
for to a small degree by protracted development.
These characteristics of bromide paper can be utilized to
secure prints of a quality quite different from that of the
negative. Thus, if the negative has a long range of tones, a
flat print can be secured by full exposure and short development.
If, as is apt to be the case with aerial negatives, a
print of greater contrast than the negative is desired, a short
exposure with long development is called for.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 111.</span>—Characteristic curves of gas light paper.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The sensitometric curves of a typical gas light paper
“Contrast Enlarging Cyco,” are shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_111'>111</a>. Here
the contrast is a fixed characteristic of the paper, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>only effect of changing development is on the speed; that is,
exposure and development are, within limits, interchangeable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Choosing a printing paper is a matter of deciding on the
contrast required for the class of negative, and selecting a
paper which will give this contrast with a good range of
tones from a clear white to a deep black. The ideal paper
would be one which was all straight line in the H &amp; D plot.
In such a paper there would occur no loss of contrast in the
lighter tones when the high-lights were rendered by the clear
white of the paper. Too great contrast with a short straight
line portion, results in loss of detail at the ends of the scale.
A negative possessing a very great range of tones cannot be
correctly represented on one paper print—two printings
are required, one for high-lights and one for shadows, but
this difficulty is rarely to be faced in aerial views. The
greatest demand for aerial printing papers has been for those
of considerable contrast, because of the flat character of
the negatives.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <span class='large'>PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>General Considerations.</strong>—Developing, fixing and other
chemicals for aerial work differ in no essential respect from
those used in ordinary photography. Full discussions of
these are to be found in numerous texts and articles. The
aerial photographic problem is to select those most suited
for the under-exposed flat negatives characteristic of photographs
from the air. At the same time selection from among
the chemicals of appropriate quality must be governed by
considerations of the conditions surrounding work in aerial
photographic laboratories. These laboratories, especially
in war-time, are apt to be most primitive in their facilities.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Characteristics of Developers for Plates and Films.</strong>—From
the standpoint of practicability, aerial negative developers
should have good keeping power, be slow to exhaust,
and work well over a considerable range of temperatures.
From the standpoint of the photographic quality desired in
the negative, the developer should bring up the maximum
amount of under-exposed detail. This means that it should
impart the highest possible speed to the plate, with good
contrast, and low fog or general reduction of unexposed
silver bromide.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many characteristics to study in a developer:
its effect on inertia or speed, gamma infinity, fog, time of
appearance, “Watkins factor,” speed of development, temperature
coefficient, dilution coefficient, keeping power,
exhaustion, length of rinsing, stain, color coefficient and
resolving power. These are defined and described as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Effect on inertia.</em> The meaning of inertia has already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>been given under the discussion of plate speed. While this
is a constant, independent of time of development, for any
one developer, it is altered appreciably by change of the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Time-gamma relation.</em> Contrast, symbolized by <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span>, has
likewise been discussed under plate sensitometry. Viewed
from the standpoint of the developer, the point of interest
is the rate at which <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span> varies with development, and the
maximum contrast which can be reached or <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span> infinity.
Speed of development is commonly defined by the <em>velocity
constant</em>, symbolized by <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">κ</span>, which is arrived at mathematically
from a consideration of the time of development to
produce two different contrast values. High <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">γ</span> infinity is
desired for aerial negatives, and for rapid work <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">κ</span> must
also be high.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Fog.</em> The opacity due to chemical fog is to be kept at a
minimum in aerial negatives, as it is chiefly prejudicial to
under exposures.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Time of appearance and Watkins factor.</em> The time of
appearance is measured in seconds. The Watkins factor is
a practical measure of the speed of development, and is determined
by the ratio of the time of development required for
a definite contrast, to the time of appearance. It is useful
also as a guide to development time.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Temperature coefficient.</em> This is the factor by which the
time of development at normal temperature (20 Cent.) must
be increased or decreased in order to obtain the same quality
negative, for a change of seven degrees either side of normal.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Temperature limits</em> are the temperatures between which
development can be carried out with any degree of control
or without serious damage to the negative. These factors
are of great importance where climatic or seasonal changes
have to be endured.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Dilution coefficient.</em> This is the factor by which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>development time is increased in order to maintain a given
quality negative in different dilutions of the developer. It
is useful in tank development.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Keeping power.</em> The keeping power of a developer,
mixed ready for use, is determined by its ability to resist
aerial oxidation. A developer of poor keeping power, which
must be made up immediately before use, causes delay and
waste of time whenever emergency work has to be done,
whereas a developer of good keeping power may be left in
its tank ready for instant use.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Exhaustion</em> of a developer is the rate at which it becomes
useless for developing, due both to aerial oxidation and to the
using up of its reducing power by the work done in developing
plates. It is conveniently measured by the area of plate
surface developable before the solution must be renewed.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Length of rinsing.</em> The time required for rinsing between
development and fixing bath plays a not unimportant part
in total development time. Dichroic fog is caused with
some developers if, due to insufficient rinsing, any of the
caustic alkali is carried over to the fixing bath. Stains
develop also if the fixing bath is old, or if light falls on the
unfixed plate while any developer remains in the film.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Color coefficient.</em> The function of the sulphite, which
forms a constituent of all developing solutions, is two-fold.
It acts partly as a preservative, and partly to prevent the
occurrence of a yellow color in the deposit. The yellow color,
if present, increases the photographic contrast. This phenomenon
has been purposely utilized, particularly in the
British service, to give “stain” to negatives which otherwise
would show insufficient printing density. The color index
or coefficient of a negative (with a given printing medium)
is the ratio of photographic to visual density. If we take a
pyro developer containing five parts of pyro per thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>and ten parts of sodium carbonate, and then vary the amount
of sulphite from none to fifty parts per thousand, the color
index varies as follows:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>The color index is somewhat different with various kinds
of printing media.</p>

<p class='c000'>This staining effect is a variable one, depending upon
length of development, dilution of the developer, length of
rinsing, temperature, the fixing bath used (plain hypo being
necessary for a maximum effect), the length of washing after
fixation and the properties of the water used. Standardization
of these conditions in the field is difficult; hence any
developer which will give the same effective contrast without
resorting to stain is to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Resolving power.</em> Some developing processes and conditions
will introduce bad grain into the negative. Hence the
resolving power which a developer brings up must be investigated
among its other characteristics.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Practical Developers for Aerial Negatives.</strong>—In the English
service a pyro metol developer was generally used, producing
stained negatives. The French, American and Italian practice
was to use metol-hydrochinon, without staining. A
special chlor-hydrochinon developer, worked out by the
Eastman Research Laboratory for the United States Air
Service, has probably the greatest merit of any yet tried.
A comparison, given below, between it and a pyro metol
formula used on a representative plate, illustrates the use
of the various bases of study given above.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Intensification and Reduction.</strong>—These processes have
been little employed in air work. Reduction is rarely necessary,
for obvious reasons. Intensification would often be of
value, but the common practice, which saves some time, is
to use printing paper of strong contrast for those negatives
which are deficient in density and contrast. When intensification
is desirable or permissible, either the ordinary mercury
or uranium intensifier may be used.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Water.</strong>—In the field it is found necessary in many cases
to purify the water that is to be used in mixing up chemicals.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Water may contain suspended matter or dirt, dissolved
salts, and slime. It is important to remove the suspended
matter, as it may cause spots on the plates and papers,
while any slime would coagulate, forming a sludge in the
developer which would also tend to settle on the plates and
cause marks during development. The dissolved salts may
or may not cause trouble. Two methods of purification
are possible:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Filter the water through a cloth into a barrel, add
about one gram of alum for every four litres of water, and
allow to settle over night. Draw off the clear liquid from a
plug in the side as required.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) Boil the water and allow it to cool over night. If the
water contains dissolved lime, boiling will often cause this
to come out of solution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Field Requirements.</strong>—Developing, fixing, drying and
printing in the field demand simple and convenient apparatus
that may be carried about and installed with the least
amount of labor. On top of these requirements military
needs impose others that are more difficult. <em>Speed</em> is, on
occasion, imperative. A print may be required within a
few minutes after landing, and many thousands within a
few hours. Quantity production must be achieved under
the most primitive conditions. Nothing, in fact, shows the
calibre of the photographic officer better than his choice of
workplaces as the army moves forward. Ingenuity and
practical judgment are at a premium. Cellars, stables, dog
kennels, or huts hastily built from packing cases, must be
equipped and in working order over night. All the facilities
offered by a great city are urgently needed—water, electric
light, power for driving fans—but must be dispensed with
if the photographic section is to be convenient to the airdrome,
whose portable hangars are most apt to be pitched
in the open country. Water must be carried, electricity
generated, and to the photographic problem is added the
military one of concealment and protection. Dugouts and
bomb proofs must be built for supplies, and “funk holes”
for the men. Entire underground emergency extensions
have sometimes been built in stations occupied for extended
periods, for airdromes are a favorite bombing target.</p>

<p class='c000'>For getting the exposed plates to the photo section,
messengers, on motorcycles if possible, are employed. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>some cases, where hangars and photographic hut are forced
to be widely separated, recourse has been had to parachutes
(Fig. <a href='#fig_112'>112</a>), a device also employed to distribute prints to
infantry during an advance.</p>

or devastated country, where cellars are unavailable, the

(Figs. <a href='#fig_113'>113</a>, <a href='#fig_114'>114</a>, <a href='#fig_115'>115</a>), the former for hauling supplies and
electric light generating plant, the latter fitted as a complete
developing and printing laboratory, form the headquarters
of each photographic section in the field. Usually altogether
too small for the amount of work required, they were extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>by tents and lean-to's, or ingeniously used as a
nucleus for the organization of the favored stable or cellar.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Methods of Plate Development.</strong>—Where speed is not
required the simplest and commonest mode of developing
plates is in the tray, one plate at a time. Common practice
is to examine the plate at intervals during development,
and discontinue the operation on the basis of its appearance.
This is only possible if the plates used are insensitive to some
light by which the eye can see. Deep red light is suitable
for ordinary and most orthochromatic plates. A faint blue-green
may be used with some panchromatic plates. The
best practice, however, is to develop by time in total darkness,
whereby all chance of dark room fog is avoided. Development
time for plates of the average exposure of the one to
be developed is either known from previous experience, or is
found by trial on the first one. Development by time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>results in negatives of densities varying with the exposures,
but, as was brought out in the discussion of sensitometry,
this difference can be compensated for by the choice of the
paper used for printing, and by its treatment.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 114.</span>—Interior of photographic trailer, developing room.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Where larger quantities of plates are to be handled <em>tank
development</em> is adopted. In ordinary tank development the
plates are placed in grooved tanks, into which is poured first
the developer, next the rinsing water, and then the hypo.
It has been customary in tank development as practiced for
peace-time work to use dilute developer, requiring from ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to thirty minutes, but speed requirements in war-time aerial
photography dictate the use of full-strength quick-acting
developer. An improvement on the simple grooved tank is
provided by metal cages or racks, each holding a dozen or
more plates, which may be introduced or removed from the
tank as a unit (Fig. <a href='#fig_116'>116</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The <em>core rack</em> system combines certain of the features of
both tray and tank development. Each plate is inserted in
a separate metal frame with projecting lugs to rest on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>top of the tank and so suspend the plate in the solution.
The process of development is the same as in the tank system,
but any individual plate may be examined and removed.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Film Developing and Fixing.</strong>—The problem of quickly
handling roll film of large size is one upon whose solution
depends in large degree the feasibility of film cameras for
aerial work. It presents many difficulties: a long film is
unwieldy, is inherently subject to curling, and takes up much
space if it is handled entire. For small scale operations roll
film can be cut into short strips and developed either by
drawing through a tray or, if cost of developer is no object,
in a deep tank. In order to make the cutting apart of exposures
easy in the dark, film cameras should make some form
of punch mark in the film between the exposed parts, or the
space between exposures should be uniform, so that a print
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>trimmer set to a definite mark may be used. Racks for holding
two or three feet of film, folded back on itself and clasped
by spring clothes-pins, are fairly practical. One object of
the use of film, however, is to greatly increase the number of
possible exposures; and where hundreds instead of dozens
of exposures are to be developed, this method takes up
entirely too much time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Following the practice in moving picture development,
<em>film developing machines</em> of various designs have been devised.
Among these may be described the G. E. M. machine; the
Ansco machine; the Eastman apron machine; the Brock
frame and tank apparatus; the Eastman reel machine; and
a modification of the latter by the United States Air Service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The G. E. M. film developing apparatus, similar in idea
to the Eastman “apron” method of film developing, as exemplified
in the familiar amateur film developing machines, has
the film wound in a spiral on a long linked metal frame or
chain. After being wound it is placed in a tub of developer,
from that to a tub of water, thence to a tub of hypo, and
finally to a tub of water, where it is washed in several changes.
The objections to the method are that it takes up much
floor space for the various tubs, and that it requires such
large quantities of solution. To develop a thirty-five foot
length of 18 × 24 centimeter exposures requires approximately
28 gallons of developer; for the rinsing, 28 gallons of water,
and the same for hypo, and at least three times that for
washing. In all 168 gallons of water must be brought to the
developing hut or lorry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Ansco machine makes use of an idea frequently
applied in the moving picture industry. The film is carried
spirally, upon two cross-arms which bisect each other at
right angles, and which contain vertical pins around which
the film is looped, beginning at the center and working out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>After it is wound it is placed in a tub of developer, as in the
G. E. M. machine. It has an advantage over this apparatus
in that the shape of the tubs or tanks is square instead of
round. But it is equally extravagant of space and water.</p>

<p class='c000'>This same criticism may be made of the Eastman apron
apparatus for film developing. This is similar to the G. E. M.
machine, but differs from it in using a perforated celluloid
apron to support the film during the various operations,
instead of a metal chain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Brock developing outfit consists of a rectangular
wooden frame and a three-compartment tank. The frame,
which is approximately 3 by 4 feet in size, is used as a support
for the 4 inch wide film, which is wound spirally around it,
between guiding pins. A special support is provided, on
which the frame may be rotated as the film is fed off the
camera spool. The frame, with the film on it, is lowered
successively into the three narrow but deep compartments
of the developing tank. The first compartment holds
developer, the next water, the next hypo. The amount of
developing solution required is rather large (96 gallons of
water in all for a strip of 100 4 × 5 inch exposures), but
because of the small surface exposed to the air, it keeps for
a considerable period. The chief demand for floor space with
this apparatus is for feeding the film on to the frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Eastman twin reel machine the film is wound on a
wooden drum or reel of large diameter, to form a helix. The
drum is suspended so that the bottom edge touches the developing
solution, and, upon revolving the drum, every portion
of the helix of film is brought into contact with the developer.
By shaping the developing tank so that it closely conforms
to the shape of the reels, a high economy in quantity of
developing agent can be achieved. When developing action
is finished, the developer is emptied out, rinse water put in;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>hypo follows, and then comes the final washing with water.
With this apparatus the whole cycle is completed, for the 35
feet length of film above considered, with seven gallons of water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Air Service apparatus differs from the above only
in the drying method, which will be described below.</p>

<p class='c000'>Heavy cut film, such as is marketed under the name of
Portrait Film, has not thus far been used in aerial work,
except for printing transparencies. It is conceivable, however,
that film in the cut form may be used in some future design
of camera. This may be developed expeditiously in a tray,
six or eight films being handled at a time, in a pile, pulling
out the lower one frequently and placing it on top. The
core rack system is also available for film in this form, special
racks with clips to hold the film being necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Plate Drying.</strong>—The drying of negatives on glass is a
comparatively simple matter, owing to the rigid nature of
the emulsion support. A large number of plates may be
placed in a compact mass in the ordinary plate racks of
commerce with the wet sides accessible to a draft of air.
Two dozen plates separated from each other by a quarter
of an inch and left to dry spontaneously in a room of ordinary
humidity and living temperature will dry in two hours
and a half. If the surface be wiped with soft cheese-cloth
or chamois, so as to absorb all the surface moisture before
the plates are placed on the rack, this time may be appreciably
reduced. By placing the plates in a forced draft of air,
from an electric fan, this time may be reduced to an hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Extra rapid drying of plates may be accomplished by
placing them in a bath of alcohol before putting them in the
racks. The alcohol displaces all the water in the film, and
is itself very quickly dissipated into the atmosphere when the
plate is taken from the tray. The plate must be left in the
alcohol tray long enough for the substitution of the alcohol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>for the water in the film to take place. Five minutes is long
enough. The alcohol before use must be as nearly free from
water as possible. The best way to make sure of this is to
place in the bottle of alcohol some lumps of calcium oxide,
which will take up the water and form calcium hydroxide,
which settles at the bottom of the bottle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another method of quick plate drying takes advantage
of the extraordinary greediness of potassium carbonate for
water. The wet plates are placed in a saturated solution of
potassium carbonate and left for a minute. If a plate be now
taken from the solution and its surface wiped with a soft
cloth, it will be found that the film has a greasy, slippery
feeling, but that it contains no water and can be printed from
at once. Plates so treated should be washed, however, at
some time in the succeeding four months, or the traces of
potassium carbonate left in the film cause deterioration.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Film Drying.</strong>—Unlike the drying of plates, drying of film
negatives is a very puzzling problem, and may be considered
as the crux of the successful use of film in aerial cameras.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apron and similar machines have very poor drying efficiency
if the film is left in place, for not only the film but the
apron or chain must be freed of water. This may be hastened,
as in the G. E. M. machine, by blowing air through
with fans, but even with their help drying a 35 foot film is a
matter of two hours or more. Passing the film through
wringers or a squeegee to remove excess water is a considerable
aid; the film may either be re-wound on a dry reel, to be
put in a forced draft of air, or may be hung up in short lengths
or festooned, either method taking up a great deal of space.
The use of alcohol is not advisable as it may abstract camphor
from the celluloid and cause the film to become distorted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Eastman twin reel machine had an upper reel joined
to the lower or developing reel, with a chain and sprockets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>so that the upper reel revolved at the same time and rate of
revolution as the lower, when the lower was being revolved
at the gentle speed appropriate to the developing process.
Fans blew a draft of air over the upper reel. This method
necessitated over an hour for drying.</p>

<div id='fig_117'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 117.</span>—U. S. Air Service film developing machine for film 24 centimeters wide.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Air Service model of film developing and drying
machine (Fig. <a href='#fig_117'>117</a>) introduces an essential modification in
the drying scheme of the Eastman apparatus. The upper
reel is quite independent of the lower reel and is revolved at
a high rate of speed, so that a whirling action is introduced
into the drying. Large rotating fans at the same time drive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>a considerable volume of air across the film surface, and the
combination of the two agencies makes it possible to dry
35 feet of 18 × 24 centimeter film in 20 to 30 minutes. This
for large numbers of pictures makes the use of film even
quicker than that of plates. The only practical drawback
to the apparatus is its bulk, which calls for a separate room
or trailer. This, however, seems to be inevitable in the use
of large roll film.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cut film can be dried with speed only if placed in a draft
of warm air. Drying boxes, with a chute or chimney and
with fans to drive the air through from an alcohol stove,
will dry several dozen films in an hour. The films must not
be closer together than about one inch, which makes the
drying boxes rather cumbersome.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Marking Negatives.</strong>—After development and drying,
and before filing or printing, each plate should be marked
with data for purposes of future identification. This is most
easily done with pen and ink on the film side (in reversed
lettering) either along an edge in the unexposed portion
covered by the sheath or in a corner, so as to lose as little
of the photograph as possible. Just what data shall be inscribed
is dictated by the purpose for which the negative was
made. The date, altitude, time of day, true north (from
known permanent features or from shadow direction and
time of day), number of the camera used, the focal length of
the lens. Other records, such as the plane and squadron
numbers, or even the pilot's and observer's initials, may be
called for (Fig. <a href='#fig_075'>75</a>). For mapping work the scale of each
of a set of negatives, once found, may be marked, either in
figures or by means of a line of length corresponding to a
fixed distance on the ground. Rectifying data can similarly
be inscribed, so that the negative can be printed in the enlarging
and rectifying camera with the minimum of delay.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <span class='large'>PRINTING AND ENLARGING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Contact Printing.</strong>—Single prints are made most simply
in a printing frame held at a short distance from a light
source. When any quantity must be made, as in turning
out prints at high speed for distribution to an army before
an attack, <em>printing machines</em> are employed. These consist
essentially of a light box, a printing frame of plate glass,
and a pressure pad. In the commercial models, such as the
Crown and the Ansco, which are equipped with electric light,
merely bringing the pressure pad down and clamping it
automatically turns on the light, while release of pressure
terminates the exposure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of regulating the distribution of light is of
considerable importance with negatives taken by focal-plane
shutters of non-uniform rate of travel. In the McIntire
printer (Fig. <a href='#fig_119'>119</a>), the separate electric bulbs are on long
necks in ball and socket joints, so that they can be brought
individually closer to the printing surface or farther away
from it, thus permitting a wide range of “dodging.” This
printer also has an automatic time control for the light, a
valuable device where many prints from the same negative
are desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>These machines are well suited for printing aerial negatives,
either plate or cut film, if used where a source of electric
current is available. The chief defect, which may be
caused by faulty construction, is imperfect contact between
paper and negative, a cause of serious unsharpness on prints
destined for minute study in interpretation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The printing of aerial negatives may be done either on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>roll or cut paper, and if films are used, a further alternative
is offered of handling it either in the roll or in cut form.
Where many prints are to be made from one negative roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>paper has some advantages, particularly if a developing and
drying machine is available. But for moderate numbers the
advantage is small, since cut prints can be developed quite
conveniently in goodly numbers in the ordinary trays. But
the advantages of keeping film in the roll form are very
great, both in respect to storage and in respect to handling
during printing, as the rollers provide the necessary tension
and prevent the film “getting away.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For the American Air Service, cut paper has been used
exclusively. For film printing, the Ansco machine has been
equipped with roll pivots to take film 24 centimeters wide
which may be advanced in either direction by turning large
milled heads (Fig. <a href='#fig_120'>120</a>). If we put rollers on the two remaining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>sides of the box to handle paper we transform the printer
into the same form as a French machine, in which paper and
film are moved at right angles to each other. A disadvantage
of this modification, however, is the difficulty of examining
the negative to be printed.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Stereo Printing.</strong>—To make separate prints from the two
elements of a stereoscopic pair and mount them side by side
after proper orientation is too slow a process if quantities
of prints are needed. One method of multiple production
is to make a master stereogram, and then produce photographic
copies of it, but there is inevitable loss of quality
in this copying process. An intermediate method is to print
from both negatives on the same sheet of paper. In order
to do this the negatives must be placed in rather large frames,
with mats properly located to guide the placing of the paper.
The Richard double printing frame is a practical device
which simplifies the necessary manipulations. It consists
essentially of a platform pierced with three illuminated
openings. The two negatives are compared, superposed,
and orientated over the central opening and then shifted
laterally, one to each of the two side openings, which serve
both as printing frames and masks. The printing back
slides on a rod, permitting the paper to be lifted up and
moved between exposures. Once the negatives are properly
placed, stereo prints can be turned out quickly and easily.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Enlarging.</strong>—In the French service contact printing was
the rule during the war. The English practice, on the other
hand, was to take small negatives—4 × 5 inches, with 8 to
12 inch lenses—and enlarge them, usually to 6½ × 8½ inches.
For this purpose a regular part of the English photo section
equipment was the <em>enlarging camera</em> (Fig. <a href='#fig_115'>115</a>). This may
be briefly described as a short focus camera in which the
subject to be photographed is a negative, illuminated by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>transmitted light, whose image is thrown by the camera
lens on the paper or other sensitive surface. By making
the distance between negative and lens less than that
between lens and paper, the resulting print is an enlargement,
and <em>vice versa</em>. The scale of enlargement or of reduction
is varied over limits set only by the length of the camera
and the amount of light available.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lens employed must of course possess sufficiently
high quality to preserve all the sharpness of the negative,
and focussing must be done with accuracy. Next to the lens
the most important element is the light source. This may
be of the point form, such as a concentrated filament electric
lamp, an oxy-acetylene lime light, or an acetylene flame.
The latter was extensively used in the English service, while
acetylene generators for emergency purposes formed part of
each American photo truck equipment. With point light
sources we must use <em>condensers</em> to focus the light into the
projecting lens. Much less efficient, but the only recourse
where large condensers are not available, is a diffusing glass
behind the negative, illuminated either by a bank of electric
lamps with mirrors or by a U tube mercury vapor lamp,
where proper current can be got.</p>

<p class='c000'>The device for holding the printing paper must permit
quick changing, but insure good contact. We may use
either a spring plate to hold the paper against plate glass
from behind, or else a weight acting on a lever arm of
sufficient length.</p>

<p class='c000'>The need for some automatic means of focussing an
enlarging camera has been very generally felt. An illustration
of such an enlarging camera is that put out by Williams,
Brown &amp; Earle, of Philadelphia, known as the “Semperfocal”
(Fig. <a href='#fig_121'>121</a>). In this camera the movements of the lens,
paper easel and negative are so inter-related and actuated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>with respect to each other that the correct focus of the
instrument is maintained for any degree of enlargement
or reduction. This feature is a great help in making up
mosaic maps, where prints of continuously varying scale
ordinarily occasion serious delay for individual focussing.</p>

<div id='fig_121'  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 121.</span>—“Semperfocal” enlarging camera, with mechanism for holding image in focus at any enlargement.<br /></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c000'>Determining the correct enlargement for each negative
of a mosaic is perhaps the most important problem in the
use of the enlarging camera for aerial work. The correct
setting of the camera may be found by either of two methods:
the negative may be previously scaled and marked with a
line on its edge, which must be projected to a definite size;
or the true location of several points in the picture as
obtained from an accurate map may be marked on the
enlarging camera easel according to the desired scale, and
the negative image projected to coincide with these. In
either case, if an exact scale is desired, allowance must be
made for paper shrinkage, a matter which must be determined
by previous experiment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><strong>Rectifying.</strong>—Negatives taken when the plane is not
flying level will be distorted (Figs. <a href='#fig_134'>134</a> and <a href='#fig_135'>135</a>). Contact
prints from these will not fit into a mosaic, and no mere
enlargement or reduction will make them available. It is
necessary with these negatives to resort to a <em>rectifying
camera</em>. This is an enlarging camera built so that the negative
and print easel may be inclined about vertical and
horizontal axes, thereby purposely introducing a distortion
sufficient to offset the distortion of the negative. Thus, if
the bottom of the printing surface is moved away from the
lens, that part of the picture will be enlarged; if moved
toward the lens, reduced.</p>

<p class='c000'>For small rectifications the common practice is to tilt the
printing surface alone, a method that is practical as long as
this tilting does not affect the focus so much as to require
prohibitive stopping down of the lens. For great distortions,
such as that inherent in the principle of the Bagley camera,
it is necessary to tilt both negative and print in order to
preserve an approximate focus, a given portion of the negative
moving toward the lens as the corresponding portion
of the print is moved away. Both schemes for rectification
are shown diagrammatically in Fig. <a href='#fig_122'>122</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Developing and Drying Prints.</strong>—The developing of prints
follows closely that of cut or roll film, and so need not be
treated separately.</p>

<p class='c000'>The drying of emulsions on paper is more easily accomplished
than the drying of emulsions on glass, for two
reasons: the emulsions on paper are much more thinly
coated, and there is diffusion of moisture into the atmosphere
from front and back of the printing medium. In the field
a common method has been to soak the prints in water-free
alcohol and then burn off the alcohol, thus securing a dry
print within two or three minutes after the conclusion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>washing. A later method very generally employed is to
cover wooden frames three or four feet above the ground
with chicken wire or muslin, and on these lay the prints after
soaking them in alcohol. Below the frames currents of warm
air rise from pans of burning alcohol, previously used to
soak the prints and now useless as alcohol because of their
high water content.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Before putting them in alcohol it is advisable to squeegee
all the surface water from the prints. This may be expeditiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>done by removing them in mass from the final wash
water upon a large ferrotype plate, and either running the
plate and prints together through a wash wringer with light
pressure, or covering the whole with a sheet of blotting paper
and pressing out the water underneath by means of a rubber
squeegee vigorously applied.</p>

<p class='c000'>For base work one of the modern automatic print-drying
machines used in commercial photography would be desirable.
Glossy surfaces are given prints by the usual ferrotype
plate method. But this is too time-consuming for war
practice, and besides has but doubtful advantage where
papers of the glossy type are chosen.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“<em>Spotting</em>,” as distinct from mapping or from the photography
of continuous strips, is the photography of a definite
individual objective. In military work spotting or “pin
pointing” includes the photography of particular trenches
or pivotal points in a trench system before an attack (Fig.
<a href='#fig_123'>123</a>), of roads or bridges along which an advance must pass
(Fig. <a href='#fig_124'>124</a>), of batteries or big guns which are the subject of
artillery fire (Fig. <a href='#fig_125'>125</a>), both before and after their bombardment
(Fig. <a href='#fig_126'>126</a>), of gun puffs or exploding bombs (Fig. <a href='#fig_131'>131</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>The technique of spotting consists largely in getting properly
over the target and then securing the exposure at just
the right moment. This is chiefly a question of proper
piloting; but the aid which can be offered to the pilot by
camera auxiliaries designed particularly for spotting needs
is very large.</p>

<p class='c000'>Discussion of the task of the pilot who must steer a
photographic plane accurately over a previously selected
point of interest cannot be undertaken without raising the
question of who should take the picture, pilot or observer?
In the English service the most general practice was for the
pilot to be charged with the responsibility both of covering
the objective and of exposing. If a propeller drive was used
on the camera, this left to the observer only the task of changing
magazines. If the camera was hand operated the plates
were changed either by the observer, or else, as was frequently
the case, distance operating devices were attached,
so that the pilot even then did everything except change the
magazines, and the observer was kept free to watch the sky
for enemy aircraft. A very desirable adjunct to the camera
when plates are shifted automatically or by the observer is
a distance indicator, to show the pilot when the shutter is
set. Electrical indicators for this purpose have been devised.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>If the camera is completely hand operated, as were most
of those in the French and German services, there is little
choice but for the observer to perform the entire operation.
The exposing operation could have been delegated to the
pilot, but such was not the custom with the French or with
the American squadrons using French apparatus. In this
method of operation the observer depends on the pilot to
get the plane over the target, while the pilot depends on the
observer to get the picture when the target is covered.
Ample opportunity is thus offered for misunderstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and disagreement. This can be avoided only by excellent
sights properly aligned, for both pilot and observer,
and by some means of communication between the two
men concerned.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The simplest <em>means of communication</em> is of course direct
conversation. But this is only possible in those planes, such
as the DH-9, in which pilot's and observer's cockpits are
immediately together, so that, by shouting, any desired
information can be conveyed with fair ease. When the distance
is increased to four or five feet, as in the DH 4, the
loudest shouts are totally lost in the roar of the engine and
the blast of the wind. Speaking tubes and telephones are
now fairly good, but are none too comfortable or convenient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>to have strapped on one's head and face. A primitive
device used to some extent in the war was merely a pair of
reins attached to the pilot's arms, by which he could be
directed which way to steer. There is much to be said for a
simple semaphore system, where an indicator in the observer's
cockpit actuates a similar dial in front of the pilot, indicating
“right” or “left,” “picture obtained,” “try again,” etc. If
the observer has a sight by which he can see far enough
ahead to correct the pilot's error of pointing, the need for an
accurate sight for the pilot is diminished.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In considering the question of sights, attention may
again be called to the poor “visibility” from the pilot's seat
in the present prevailing type of two-seater tractor plane.
Blind directly in front, beneath, and to either side (Figs. <a href='#fig_007'>7</a>,
<a href='#fig_008'>8</a> and <a href='#fig_009'>9</a>), it is no unusual thing for a pilot to entirely miss an
objective, such as a railway line, which he can only estimate
to be beneath him by judging its distance from those objects
to either side which he can actually see. The English practice
of leaving a clear space of six inches to a foot between the
fuselage and the beginning of the wing fabric, allows the
pilot to look down over the side, a decided advantage. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>for photographic purposes nothing can compare with a good
negative lens carrying fore and aft lines or wires, so that the
pilot can see his objective in ample time to head directly for
it. The lens should either be large enough so that its rear
edge gives the view directly downward, or supplemented by
an additional lens pointing directly down, so that the covering
of the target is assured. To locate such a lens in the front
cockpit, free of all controls, is a very hard task; even so its
view is likely to be badly interrupted by the landing gear.
Nevertheless, so important is it, both in photography and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>bombing, to have a sight by which the plane can be accurately
directed that designers of planes should recognize this
need and make every effort to provide a suitable location.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Sights for the observer have been discussed already. Here
again the negative lens is to be preferred, but while the pilot's
lens needs only directing lines in the axis of the plane (unless
he takes the picture), the observer's lens needs both an accurate
center mark and an additional upper or lower sighting
point. Accurate alignment of these marks with the camera
axis must be arranged for in precise spotting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accurate spotting work requiring the delineation of fine
detail calls for cameras of considerable focal length. The
camera of longest focal length used in the war was the French
120 centimeter (Fig. <a href='#fig_041'>41</a>). This was employed with great
success in such work as regulating the fire of heavy railway
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>guns brought into range only at night, to fire a few shots at
chosen angles. Photographs taken the next day would then
show the exact spot where each shell fell, and the damage it
did, to serve as a guide for the next night's operations (Fig.
<a href='#fig_127'>127</a>). The field of these cameras is quite small—8 to 12
degrees—and so not only must sighting be exact but the
area covered on the ground must be accurately known. This
is to be calculated from the altitude, focal length, and plate
size, by the relation—</p>

<p class='c000'>These calculations and others required in mapping and
stereo-work are simply and quickly made by slide-rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>devices. One of these, the Burchell Photographic Slide Rule,
developed in the English service, is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_130'>130</a>. This
consists of two dials, the center one of which is mounted—usually
by a pin pushed into a cork behind—so as to turn
freely, to permit its being set for altitude, focal length, ground
speed, plate size, etc., whereupon the area covered, or the
appropriate interval between exposures may be read off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Cameras for spotting work should be capable of exposure
at the exact moment desired. For if the camera is ever to
catch the gun as it discharges, the bomb as it falls (Fig. <a href='#fig_131'>131</a>),
or the shell as it explodes (Fig. <a href='#fig_132'>132</a>), the photograph must be
taken within the instant. Automatic cameras, exposing at
regular intervals, while adequate for mapping, are not fitted
for many kinds of spotting.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <span class='large'>MAP MAKING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'><strong>Technique of Negative Making.</strong>—Stated in its simplest
terms, the whole problem of making a photographic map
from the air consists in taking a large number of slightly
overlapping negatives, all from the same altitude, with the
plane flying uniformly level. When trimmed and mounted
in juxtaposition, or pasted together so as to overlap in their
common portions, the prints from these negatives constitute
a complete pictorial map. There is thus furnished by a few
hours' labor topographic information which would be the
work of months to obtain by other means.</p>

<p class='c000'>The making of map photographs involves all the special
technique of spotting, with much in addition. The pilot's
task is not merely to go over one object; he must navigate a
narrow path, at a constant altitude, on an even keel. If he
is to make not merely a ribbon, but a map of considerable
width, he must take successive trips parallel to the first,
each displaced just far enough from the previous course to
insure that no portion is missed—a difficult task indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is the observer's duty to so time the intervals between
exposures that they overlap enough, but not so much as to
be wasteful of plates or film. He must also change magazines
or films so quickly as to miss no territory, or if some be
missed, his is the task of directing the pilot back to the point
of the last exposure, where they begin a new series.</p>

<p class='c000'>Level flying is entirely a pilot's problem. Its importance
will be realized when we consider the accompanying diagrams
(Figs. <a href='#fig_134'>134</a> and <a href='#fig_135'>135</a>), where the effect on the resultant picture
is shown of climbing, gliding, or banking to either side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Prints from negatives distorted in this way neither will be
true representations of the territory photographed, nor will
they match when juxtaposed. In fact, they can be utilized
only if special rectifying apparatus is available for printing.
Flying at a constant altitude is similarly necessary if the
prints are to be utilized without enlargement or reduction
in order to make them fit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Assuming a skilled pilot who will do his part, the next
step is to calculate the exposure intervals in order to insure
an adequate overlap. If a negative lens is installed which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>has been marked with a rectangle the size of the camera
field, the simplest method is to estimate the proper instant
for exposure by watching the progress of objects across the
lens face. This of course requires constant attention, and
it is easier to do this only occasionally, in order to determine
the ground speed in terms of camera fields traversed per
minute. Thereafter exposures are to be made by time, as
determined by a watch or clock. Any desired degree of
overlap can be chosen, and either estimated, or more or less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>accurately fixed by lines marked on the negative lens at a
shorter distance apart than the edges of the field. The
most usual overlap is 20 per cent., except for stereos, which
call for 50 to 75 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the absence of a negative lens or some other sight to
show the whole camera field, it is necessary to resort to calculation
from the speed and altitude of the plane, the focus
of the lens and the dimensions of the plate. If <em>A</em> is the altitude,
<em>a</em> the focal length of the lens, <em>d</em> the diameter of the
plate in the direction of travel (usually the short length is
chosen for economy of flights to cover a given width), <em>f</em> the
fractional part by which one negative is desired to overlap
the next, and <em>V</em> the ground speed of the plane, then we have,
by simple proportion, that the interval between exposures,
<em>t</em>, must be—</p>

<p class='c000'>The principle of overlapping map exposures is shown in the
accompanying diagram (Fig. <a href='#fig_129'>129</a>), together with data calculated
as above for a 4 × 5 inch plate.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is particularly to be noted that it is the <em>ground speed</em>
of the plane that is used. This may be calculated by knowing
the air speed and the wind velocity and direction. Fig.
<a href='#fig_136'>136</a> shows the method of doing this graphically. First an
arrow is drawn representing the direction it is desired to fly.
Next a second arrow is drawn of length to represent the wind
velocity. This must be inclined toward the first arrow in
the direction of the wind, and its head is to touch the head
of the first arrow. Then with the farther end of this second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>arrow as a center, describe a circle of such a length as to
represent the air speed of the plane, in the same units as the
wind velocity. Connect the point where this circle cuts the
arrow of flight direction to the center of the circle by a
straight line. This line constitutes the air speed arrow,
giving the direction it is necessary to fly, at the given air
speed, to make the course desired. The length of the flight
direction arrow between its head and its point of intersection
with the air speed arrow gives the ground speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the wind is ahead or astern this calculation reduces
to the simple subtraction or addition of the wind velocity
to the air speed of the plane. Whenever possible, mapping
should be done up and down the wind (Fig. <a href='#fig_137'>137</a>). If the
plane is “crabbing,” the above calculations for overlap are
only valid if the camera can be turned normal to the direction
of travel over the ground. If the camera cannot be so
turned the corners of the successive pictures overlap instead
of their sides, with quite unsatisfactory results (Fig. <a href='#fig_138'>138</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Calculation of the distance apart of the parallel flights
necessary to make a map of any width is done by the use of
a formula similar to the longitudinal overlap formula above,
distance figuring instead of time. Using the same symbols,

<p class='c000'>It is of course largely a pilot's problem to steer the plane
over parallel courses at a given distance apart, although the
observer, noting conspicuous objects through a properly
marked negative lens, may direct the pilot by any of the
means of communication already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>An alternative method of securing parallel strips, which
is to be highly recommended where enough photographically
equipped airplanes are available, is for several planes to fly
side by side, maintaining their proper separation (Fig. <a href='#fig_139'>139</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Cameras and Auxiliaries for Map Making.</strong>—Mapping can
be done quite satisfactorily by hand operated or semi-automatic
cameras, provided the observer has not too many
other duties. On the other hand, the operation of exposing
at more or less definite intervals of time, irrespective of the
object immediately presented to the camera, is a largely
mechanical one. It naturally suggests the employment of an
automatic mechanism, whose speed of operation only is it
necessary to watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>If a non-automatic camera is used the timing of exposures
may be done by watching a negative lens, as described above,
or by reference to a clock, assuming that the ground speed is
known through calculation. A very practical advance over
the ordinary use of a clock is to attach a stop-watch to the
shutter release, so that it is turned back to zero and re-started
at each exposure (Fig. <a href='#fig_070'>70</a>). In passing, it may be noted that
if the stop-watch hand makes an electric contact which throws
the shutter release, then the device constitutes an attachment
for turning any semi-automatic camera into an automatic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>The most suitable cameras for mapping are unquestionably
those of the entirely automatic type. The use of such
cameras always demands a knowledge of the ground speed.
This demand has led to many suggestions for <em>ground speed
indicators</em>. The common idea of these is to provide a moving
part on the plane—either a disc of large diameter, or a chain,
or a revolving screw—whose speed may be varied until any
point upon it appears to keep in coincidence with a point on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>the moving landscape below. The ground speed is then to
be read off a properly calibrated dial. Or, as a further step,
the frequency of the exposures may be directly controlled
by the ground speed indicator mechanism. The entire
control of the camera would then consist merely in occasional
adjustment of the ground speed indicator.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 139.</span>—Planes starting out to make a map by flying in parallel.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>While entirely possible in theory, these devices are not
easy to work with in practice, because the plane is always
subject to some pitching and rolling, which make it difficult
to hold any object constantly on the moving point. This is
especially true at high altitudes, where the apparent motion
of the earth is quite slow compared to the swervings of the
plane. This objection is in part removed if the ground speed
indicator is carried by a gyro stabilizer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ordinary mapping does not demand such exquisite
rendering of detail as does trench mapping. Nor is it necessary
to fly in peace-time at such high altitudes as in war.
In consequence, mapping cameras are preferably of the short
focus, wide angle type, say, 25 centimeter focus for an 18 × 24
centimeter plate. Film is to be preferred over plates because
of the greater number of exposures it is possible to make on a
flight. The shutter of the mapping camera must be extremely
uniform in its rate of travel so that the elements of
the map may match in tone (Fig. <a href='#fig_140'>140</a>). A mount which
permits the camera to be turned normal to the direction of
flight, such as the British turret mount (Fig. <a href='#fig_087'>87</a>), is particularly
desirable if flying across the wind is necessary, as will
often be the case in mapping strips between towns or between
flying fields. Devices to indicate compass direction and
altitude are called for in new and poorly mapped territory,
and may be expected to receive intensive study in the future.
The question of their utility is, however, bound up with the
whole question of the sphere of aerial photographic mapping.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Up to the present this has been almost entirely a matter of
filling in details on maps obtained by the regular surveying
methods, or of making pictorial maps for aviators. To what
extent primary mapping can be done by the airplane is yet
to be determined.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 140.</span>—A strip map, showing effect of uneven focal plane shutter action.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At this point mention must be made of special cameras
for securing extremely wide angle views, thereby minimizing
the number of flights. The <em>Bagley camera</em>, devised by Major
Bagley of the U. S. Engineers, is an example. It has three
lenses, a middle one pointing directly downward, and one to
either side at an angle of 35 degrees. The pictures obtained
with the side cameras are of course greatly distorted, and
must be rectified in a special rectifying camera. The resultant
definition is not good, but as the maps are made on a
much smaller scale than the original pictures, this is not a
serious objection. It is a matter for the future to decide
whether the additional labor on the ground necessary for
the rectifying process is to be more expensive than the extra
flights which must be made with the ordinary types of cameras
covering a smaller angle.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Printing and Mounting Mosaics.</strong>—With an ordinary set
of overlapping negatives the first step toward producing a
map is to <em>scale</em> the negatives. For this purpose one should
be selected which by comparison with a map shows no distortion,
and which is on the desired scale, or is known to
have been made at the average altitude of flight. A sketch
map of the territory should then be drawn, on this scale,
based on available maps. This sketch is preferably made
on a large ground glass illuminated from behind (Fig. <a href='#fig_141'>141</a>).
On this all the negatives should be laid, and their proper
relative positions sought. When this is done it is evident at
once whether all the territory has been covered, and whether
there are any superfluous negatives. Each negative should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>then be examined as to its scale and distortion. If it can be
made to fit the scale by simple enlargement or reduction, a
line can be drawn on one edge of a length indicating its
scale. This line will later be used as a guide in the enlarging
camera. If the picture is badly distorted it must either be
replaced by another negative, or if rectifying apparatus
is available, it must be set aside for the making of a
rectified print.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 141.</span>—Scaling negatives for mosaic map-making.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The next step is to make prints from the negatives, which
may be done either by contact, or, necessarily if differences
of scale must be compensated, in the enlarging camera. If
prints to an exact scale are required the shrinkage of the
paper must be determined and allowed for. The prints must
all show the same tone, and must be uniform from edge to
edge. If the focal-plane shutter is not uniform in its travel,
as is frequently the case, this means that the print must be
“dodged,” or exposed more at one edge than the other, by
locally shielding the plate and paper during exposure. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>case of the step-like effect caused by uneven shutter action
is shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_140'>140</a>. The effect due to uneven shutter action
is of course absent with a between-the-lens shutter, which
constitutes a strong argument in favor of that type for use
in mapping cameras.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 142.</span>—Arranging prints for a mosaic map.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>When the prints are made they must be mounted together
on a large card or cloth background. For a very small
mosaic they may be juxtaposed by simple examination,
matching corresponding details in successive prints. For a
mosaic of any size an accurate outline map must be drawn
on the surface to which the prints are to be attached. The
prints are then laid out on this outline, moved to their
correct positions, and held down by pins (Fig. <a href='#fig_142'>142</a>). When
they are all arranged the final mounting may be begun.
The excess paper, beyond what is necessary for safe overlaps,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>may be trimmed off, exercising judgment as to which print
of each adjacent pair is of the better quality, and utilizing
it for the top one at the overlapping junction. If one print
shows serious distortion it may be placed under its fellows
on all four edges, thus minimizing its weight. The edges
are best made irregular by <em>tearing</em>. Straight edges are apt
to force themselves on one's attention in the final mosaic
and give an erroneous impression of the existence of straight
roads or other features. Both forms of edging are shown in
Figs. <a href='#fig_124'>124</a> and <a href='#fig_143'>143</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>An alternative method of securing the final print mosaic,
where film negatives are used, is to trim successive film
negatives so that the trimmed sections will exactly juxtapose,
instead of overlap. The sections are then mounted, by
stickers at their edges, on a large sheet of glass, and printed
together. Captured German prints show that this was the
method commonly used with the German film camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_062'>62</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be noted that the procedure which has been
described and illustrated by Figs. <a href='#fig_142'>142</a> and <a href='#fig_143'>143</a> assumes the
previous existence of a map accurately placing at least the
chief features of the country covered. This draws attention
at once to the limitations and true sphere of aerial photographic
mapping at the present time. With the cameras
thus far it is not possible, nor is it attempted, to do primary
mapping of unknown regions. Distortions due to lens,
shutter, film warping and paper shrinkage considerably
exceed the figures permitted in precision mapping. From
the standpoint of geodetic accuracy the cumulative errors
of deviations in direction, altitude and level, peculiar to
flying, would soon become prohibitive.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The great field for aerial photographic mapping in the
near future lies in filling in detail on maps heretofore completed
as to general outlines, or, as in the war, on maps far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>out of date. The war-time procedure in country largely
unknown, such as Mesopotamia, was probably closely that
which will be necessary in peace. Conspicuous points in the
landscape were first triangulated from friendly territory, and
from these the outline map was drawn, whose details were
to be supplied by aerial photographs. Much of the “mapping”
of cross country aerial routes so far done is frankly of
a pictorial nature, showing conspicuous landmarks and good
landing fields—extremely valuable and useful, but not to be
confused with precision mapping. In assembling mosaics of
this kind the elaborate procedure described above is not
followed. The process is the simple one of juxtaposing
adjacent prints as accurately as possible by visual examination.
Errors are of course cumulative, but as long as exact
distances are not in question this is no matter.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <span class='large'>OBLIQUE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oblique views from the airplane are of very great value.
While vertical views are more searching in many respects,
they do nevertheless present an aspect of the earth with
which ordinary human experience is unfamiliar. Consequently
they are difficult to interpret without special training.
They suffer, too, from the military standpoint, from the
limitation that it is with vertical extension just as much as
with horizontal that an army has to contend in its progress.
Elevations and depressions of land show on an oblique view
where they would be entirely missed in a vertical one. For
illustration, study the picture of part of the outskirts of
Arras (Fig. <a href='#fig_144'>144</a>), presenting moat, walls and embankments,
all of which would be serious obstacles, but would hardly be
noticed on a vertical view. Pictures taken from directly
overhead are eminently suited to artillery use, but oblique
views of the territory to be attacked, taken from low altitudes,
formed an essential part of the equipment of the
infantry in the later stages of the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pictorially, oblique views are undoubtedly the most
satisfactory. The most revealing aspect of any object is
not one side or face alone, but the view taken at an angle,
showing portions of two or three sides. Best of all is that
taken to show portions of front, side and top—the well-known
but heretofore fictitious “bird's-eye view” (Fig. <a href='#fig_145'>145</a>).
This possibility is ordinarily denied the surface-of-the-earth
photographer, but the proper vantage point is attained in
the airplane.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aerial obliques may be taken at any angle, although a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>distinction is sometimes made between obliques of high
angle and panoramic or low angle views (Fig. <a href='#fig_146'>146</a>). In
addition to ordinary obliques, a very beautiful development
is the stereo oblique. Both kinds of oblique photography
call for special instrumental equipment and technique.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Methods and Apparatus for Oblique Photography.</strong>—The
simplest method of taking oblique pictures from a plane is
to use a hand camera pointed at the desired angle. Its limitations
are in the size and scale of the picture obtainable,
and in the inherent limitations to the method of camera
support. A step in advance of this is to mount the camera
above the fuselage, on the machine gun ring or turret, in
place of the gun. Considerably greater rigidity is thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>obtained, and heavier cameras can be utilized, although the
wind resistance is a serious factor. Excellent obliques have
been made in this way, even with 50-centimeter cameras,
but the scheme is impractical in military planes, because of
the removal of machine gun protection.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>If the camera is fixed in the fuselage in its normal vertical
position, obliques may be and have been taken by the simple
expedient of <em>banking</em> the plane steeply. This is not to be
recommended as a standard procedure, especially for taking
a consecutive series of exposures.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most satisfactory arrangements for taking obliques
are two; first, to mount <em>the camera obliquely in the plane</em>, and
second, to use a <em>mirror or prism</em>, in front or behind the lens
of the vertically mounted camera. The first method
has been employed chiefly by the French, the latter
by the English, whose gravity fed cameras could not be
mounted obliquely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking up first the oblique mounting of cameras, we
find two ways of doing this: longitudinal mounting and
lateral mounting. In longitudinal mounting the camera
projects forward and downward, usually from the nose of a
pusher or bi-motored plane. With this form of mounting
(Fig. <a href='#fig_147'>147</a>) it is necessary of course to fly directly toward the
objective. If this is a portion of enemy trench, which must
be photographed from a height of 400 or 500 meters, the
plane will be directly on top of its objective a few seconds
after the exposure is made, and be a conspicuous target, in
imminent danger of destruction. Moreover, only a single
short section of the trench would be obtained for each crossing
of the line. The one case where resort to this method is
practically forced is with the 120-centimeter cameras which
simply cannot be slung athwart the plane. There is a slight
advantage in this method of carrying in that the motion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the image is less if the objective is approached, instead of
being passed at the side, and so longer exposures can be made.
The longitudinal mounting has, however, been very generally
superseded by the lateral.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 147.</span>—120-centimeter camera mounted obliquely in the fore-and-aft position.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Methods for mounting cameras obliquely for taking pictures
through the side of the plane have been discussed in
detail in connection with camera mountings and installations
(Fig. <a href='#fig_093'>93</a>). The chief difficulties are want of space, obstacles
at the side such as control wires and longerons, and failure
of the camera to function properly at an angle. Even in the
broad circular sectioned fuselage of the Salmson plane,
quarters are so cramped that the French 50-centimeter
camera when obliquely mounted cannot be used with the
12-plate magazine, and recourse is made to thin flat double
plate-holders. Holes in the side of the fuselage should clear
all wires and should command a view unobstructed by the
wings—which often means that the camera must be carried
behind the observer's cockpit, irrespective of the suitability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>of that space from other standpoints. Cameras dependent
for their action on gravity, such as the deRam and English
L type, are unsuited for oblique suspension.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 148.</span>—Mirror on camera cone for taking oblique views.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For cameras which, because of their method of operation
or shape cannot be slung obliquely,
the only way to take
obliques is to employ mirrors
(Fig. <a href='#fig_148'>148</a>) or prisms. These
must be of the same optical
quality as the photographic
lens. They are both necessarily
of considerable weight because
they must be of large area of
face to fill the entire aperture
of an aerial lens. Mirrors are
lighter than prisms, but must
be quite thick to prevent distortion
of the surface due to any
possible strains to their mount.
Right angle glass prisms have
been used by the English with
the 8 and 10 inch L cameras.
The prisms were uniformly
tilted to an angle of 12½ degrees
from the horizontal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glass mirrors can be silvered
either on the rear or front surface.
If on the rear, both
surfaces must be accurately
parallel, which means much greater labor and expense than
if the front surface can be utilized. The difficulty with front
surface mirrors is that the metallic coating is easily tarnished
or scratched, especially if silver is used, which is almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>imperative, since all the other metals have considerably
lower reflecting powers. (Gold might serve both as mirror
and color filter, because of its yellow color.) Placing the
mirror inside the camera body in part obviates this trouble,
but means the use of a special elbow lens cone. In any case
the mirror or prism occasions at least a 10 per cent. loss of
light. Pictures taken by reflectors of any kind are reversed,
and must either be printed in a camera, or on transparent
film which may be viewed from the back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most usual condition for making obliques is to fly
very low (300 to 600 meters), with the line of sight of the
camera from 12 to 45 degrees from the horizontal. This
low altitude necessitates very short exposures, to avoid movement
of the image. The picture may be taken either the long
or the short way of the plate, depending on the character of
the object and the information desired. It is to be noted
that successive oblique pictures cannot be mounted to form
a continuous panorama—this being possible with obliques
only if they are taken from one point, as from a captive
balloon. If successive views are made on a straight flight
at intervals so as to exactly juxtapose in the foreground,
they overlap by a large margin the middle, and a point on
the horizon, if that shows, will be in the same position in
every picture. Mosaics of obliques could be made only by
some system of conical mounting.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sights for Oblique Photography.</strong>—Any of the sights
previously discussed for vertical work, such as the tube
sights, are applicable to obliques. They must, however, be
suited for mounting at an angle, in a position convenient for
the observer. In addition, provision must be made for
adjusting the angle so that the lines of sight of camera and
finder are parallel. Mounting outside the fuselage is practically
the only feasible way, and is less objectionable with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>oblique than with vertical sights, as oblique sighting does
not require the observer to stand up and lean over the edge
of the cockpit. Windows in the side of the fuselage, either
of celluloid or non-breakable glass, are a great aid to oblique
observation. Marks upon the transparent surface can be
utilized for the rear points of a sight of which the front point
is a single fixed bead or rectangle.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <span class='large'>STEREOSCOPIC AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the most striking and valuable developments in
aerial photography has been the use of stereoscopic views.
Pairs of pictures, taken with a considerable separation in
their points of view and studied later by the aid of the stereoscope,
show an elevation and a solidity which are entirely
wanting in the ordinary flat aerial vista. Often, indeed, these
attributes are essential for detecting and recognizing the
nature of objects seen from above. Stereoscopic aerial
photography has been justly termed “the worst foe of
camouflage.”</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Principles of Stereoscopic Vision.</strong>—The ability to see
objects in relief is confined solely to man and to a few of the
higher animals in whom the eyes are placed side by side.
When the eyes are so placed they both see, to a large extent,
the same objects in their fields of view. Owing to the separation
of the eyes the actual appearance of all objects not too
far away is different, and it is by the interpretation of these
differences that the brain gets the sensation of relief. Thus
in Fig. <a href='#fig_149'>149</a> the two eyes are shown diagrammatically as
looking at a cube. The right eye sees around on the right-hand
face of the cube, the left eye on the left-hand face of
the cube. The two aspects which are fused and interpreted
by the brain are shown in the lower diagram.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stereoscopic views or stereograms, made either by photography
or, in the early days, by careful drawing, consist of
pairs of pictures made of the same object from two different
points. For ordinary stereoscopic work these points are separated
by the distance between the eyes, approximately 65 millimeters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>or 2¾ inches. These two pictures are then so viewed
that each eye receives its appropriate image from the proper
direction, whereupon the object delineated stands out in relief.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 149.</span>—The principle of stereoscopic vision.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Fusion of the two elements of the stereoscopic picture
can take place without the assistance
of any instrument, if the
eyes are properly directed and
focussed, but this comes only with
practice. Holding the stereogram
well away from the face the eyes
are directed to a distant object
above and beyond, in order to
diverge the axes. Then without
converging, the eyes are dropped
to the picture, which should spring
into relief. It is necessary in
moving the eyes from the distant
object to the near stereogram to
alter their focus somewhat, depending
on how near the stereogram
is held; and the success of
the attempt to fuse the images
depends on the observer's ability
to maintain the eyes diverged for
a distant object while focussing for
a near one. Near-sighted people
(on taking off their glasses) fuse the
stereoscopic images quite easily,
since their eyes do not focus on
distant objects even when diverged for them. Transparencies
are easier to fuse than paper prints, but in any case where
a stereoscope is not used the separation of image centers
should not be more than that of the eyes.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><strong>Stereoscopes.</strong>—The easier and more usual method of
fusing the stereoscopic images is by a <em>stereoscope</em>. The
simplest form consists merely of two convex lenses, one for
each eye, their centers separated by a distance somewhat
greater than that between the eyes. Their function is to
bring the stereogram to focus, and, by the prismatic action
of the edges of the lenses, to converge the lines of sight
which pass through the centers of the two pictures to a point
in space in front of the observer. The two lenses should be
mounted so as to provide for the adjustment of their separation
to fit different eyes and print spacings. The most common
form of stereoscope is that designed by Holmes, for
viewing paper print stereograms (Fig. <a href='#fig_150'>150</a>). It has prismatic
lenses of an appropriate angle to converge pictures
whose centers are three inches apart, instead of the lesser
distance appropriate to stereograms intended for fusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>without an instrument. No adjustment is provided for
varying the lens separation, but the print can be moved to
and fro for focussing.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Another form of stereoscope, one of the first produced, is
the mirror stereoscope (Fig. <a href='#fig_152'>152</a>), now used extensively for
viewing stereo X-ray pictures. It consists of two vertical
mirrors at right angles to each other, with their edge of
contact between the eyes. The two prints to be studied are
placed to right and left, an arrangement that permits the
use of prints of any size. The convergence point is controlled
by the angle between the mirrors. The Pellin stereoscope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>(Fig. <a href='#fig_153'>153</a>) utilizes two pairs of mirrors in a way to permit the
use of large prints. The prints are, however, placed side by
side on a horizontal viewing table, which avoids certain
difficulties of illumination met with in the simpler mirror
form. The box form of stereoscope (Fig. <a href='#fig_151'>151</a>) using either
prisms or simple convex lenses, is particularly adapted for
viewing transparencies, although the insertion of a door at
the top provides illumination for paper prints. The Schweissguth
design (Fig. <a href='#fig_154'>154</a>) is intended primarily as an aid to
selecting the portions of the prints to be cut out for mounting.
The platform on which the pictures rest is composed of two
long rectangular blocks, on which are plates of glass raised
sufficiently to permit the prints to be slid underneath. The
space between the blocks allows the unused portion of the
photograph to be turned down out of the way. Prints of
any size can thus be moved about until the proper portions
for stereo mounting are found. Either block can be moved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>in its own plane and also to and from the eye, whereby two
prints of somewhat different scales can be fused.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Taking of Aerial Stereograms.</strong>—The normal separation
of the eyes is altogether too small to give an appearance
of relief to objects as far away as is the ground from a plane
at ordinary flying heights. In order to secure stereoscopic
pairs it is therefore necessary to resort to a method originally
employed for photographing distant mountains and clouds.
This is to take the two pictures from points separated by
distances much greater than the interocular separation—by
meters instead of millimeters—corresponding to the positions
of the eyes on a veritable giant. In the airplane this is accomplished
by making successive exposures as the plane flies over
the objective, at intervals to be determined by the speed, the
altitude and the amount of relief desired (Fig. <a href='#fig_155'>155</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>An all important question which arises immediately is:
What separation of points of view shall we select? If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>exposures are too close together there will be little relief;
if too distant the relief will be so great as to be unnatural,
even offensive. Obviously we cannot here establish a criterion
of <em>natural</em> appearance, since the natural appearance
to ordinary human eyes is devoid of relief. We may, however,
define <em>correct relief</em> as that obtained when <em>the apparent
height of elevated objects is right as compared with their extension
or plan</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In order to secure this condition it is necessary, first, that
each element of the stereoscopic pair be correct in its perspective.
This is fortunately an old photographic problem,
already well understood. Its solution is to view the photograph
from a distance exactly equal to the focal length of the
camera lens. Since the normal viewing distance is not less
than 25 centimeters, lenses of this focal length at least are
requisite for correct perspective. Secondly, it is necessary
for correct relief that the two views be taken with a separation
equal, on the plane of the plate, to the separation of the
eyes, or 65 millimeters. If <em>d</em> is the interocular distance, a
the viewing distance, identical with the focal length of the
lens used, and <em>A</em> the altitude, then <em>D</em>, the distance between
exposures, is given by the relation—</p>

<p class='c000'>For <em>a</em> = 25 centimeters, <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>D</em></span><br /><em>A</em></span> = <span class='overunder'><span class='under'>6.5</span><br />25</span>, approximately ¼, or the
interval between exposures must be a quarter the altitude.
With a 50 centimeter lens this becomes ⅛, and so on. These
figures show the fallacy of the suggestion sometimes made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>that we take stereoscopic pictures by two cameras placed one
at the extremity of each wing.</p>

<p class='c000'>When lenses of more than 25 centimeters focal length are
employed, the stereoscope should be one capable of throwing
the convergence point farther away than the customary
25 centimeters. In the simple lens type of instrument we
can do this by bringing the centers of the lenses closer
together, and by making the focus agree with the convergence
point by adjustment of the distance between lenses and
stereogram. If enlargements are used they should be treated
in all respects as originals made by lenses of the greater foci
corresponding to the scale of the enlargement.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all the conditions are covered, the appearance presented
in the stereoscope is that of a <em>model</em> of the original object
at a distance <em>a</em>, and <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>a</em></span><br /><em>A</em></span> times natural size. If pictures are
made at exposure intervals less than those indicated for
correct relief, they show insufficient relief. This does
not, however, give an unnatural effect, because anything
between no relief and “correct” relief appears natural with
large objects which are not ordinarily seen in relief by eyes
not Brobdignagian. Conversely, stereograms made with too
large exposure intervals show exaggerated relief. Yet this is
often no objection. It is indeed rather an advantage if we
wish to bring objects of interest to notice. Consequently,
so long as the exaggeration of relief is not offensive, the
permissible limits of exposure interval are pretty large.
Actually, the eye tolerates such great deviations from strictly
normal conditions that satisfactory stereoscopic effects are
obtained for pictures viewed at very different distances from
the focal length of the taking lens, and with the axes of the
eyes parallel or even diverging, although there is some strain
whenever focus and convergence points differ. On the whole,
therefore, it may be said that the conditions above laid down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>for correct relief are only a normal, to be approximated as
nearly as is practicable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having established the correct relation of taking points
for stereos the next problem is how to determine these when
in the plane. The simplest way is by means of a <em>stereoscopic
sight</em>. This consists essentially of two lines of sight (fixed by
beads, crosses, or other objects), inclined toward each other
at the angle determined by the ratio of the ocular separation
to the focal length of the lens. If the back sight is made a
single bead or cross, the rest of the stereo sight will consist
of two beads or crosses, separated from each other by the
ocular distance of 65 millimeters, and distant from the back
sight by the focal length of the lens (Fig. <a href='#fig_157'>157</a>). The first
picture is taken when the object is in line with the forward
pointing line of sight, the second when it lies along the backward
pointing one. Like other sights, the stereoscopic sight
may be attached either to the camera, or if this is fixed in
position, to any convenient part of the plane. A very simple
sight for vertical stereoscopic photography consists of
an inverted V painted on the side of the fuselage, so
that the eye can be placed at the vertex and sighted along
either leg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The common method of determining the space between
exposures is by the <em>time</em> interval. If <em>V</em> is the speed of the
plane, and <em>t</em> the desired time interval, we have, from the
last equation—</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>At 1000 meters altitude the interval will be half this, and so
on in proportion. If the pictures are taken with a 50 centimeter
focus camera, and are hence to be viewed at 50 centimeters
convergence distance instead of at 25, the time will
again be halved. These relations are clearly shown in the
diagram (Fig. <a href='#fig_156'>156</a>). Here the left-hand portion shows how
to find the stereoscopic base line at each altitude for each
focal length; while the right-hand portion shows how to
translate this into time interval for any plane velocity.
The Burchall slide rule (Fig. <a href='#fig_130'>130</a>) shows another way to
arrange these data in form for rapid calculation.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 156.</span>—Chart for calculating intervals between exposures for stereoscopic pictures.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Plates used for stereoscopic negatives should be at least
twice as long as the ocular separation, if correct relief is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>desired, and the full size of the stereoscope field is to be
utilized. This relation follows at once if we consider that
we wish to cut from each negative a rectangle 65 millimeters
wide, and that the image of the target has shifted 65 millimeters
between exposures. If the plate is larger than this
there is opportunity to select the view, or to pick several.
If the plate is smaller the elements of the stereogram must
be narrow strips. This, however, holds only for contact prints.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ordinary English practice in making stereo negatives
is to take successive pictures with an overlap of 60 to 75 per
cent. This practice is probably dictated by the 4 × 5 inch
plate, since 60 per cent. overlap on 4 inches means a separation
of just over an inch and a half instead of 2¾, but it
leaves 2½ inches of picture common to the two negatives.
With ¾ overlap the common portion is 3 inches, which permits
of cutting 2¾ inch prints, and allows some latitude for
irregular motion of the plane or for chance error in calculation
of intervals. Data on the basis of ¾ overlaps for a
4-inch plate are shown in connection with Fig. <a href='#fig_155'>155</a> which
shows in diagrammatic form the variation of exposure interval
with height, together with other points of interest.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Elevation Possible to Detect in Stereoscopic Views.</strong>—Can
the actual difference in elevation be discovered by the
use of stereoscopic views? An approximate idea may be
obtained from the following considerations: Suppose we
have two small point-like objects, one above the other, such
as a street lamp globe and the base of the lamp pillar. In a
view taken from directly overhead these will be superposed,
and so will not be capable of separation. But, as the point of
view is shifted sideways, the two objects separate, until a point
is reached where they can just be distinguished as double.
When this condition holds for either picture of the stereoscopic
pair it will be possible to obtain stereoscopic relief.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>Now the separation which can just be distinguished is
commonly assumed to be one minute of arc. This angle
corresponds to about <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>3400</span></span> the distance from the eye to the
object. If the object is assumed at a distance <em>a</em> from the
face, and on a line with one of the eyes, which are
separated by the distance <em>d</em>, then (all angles being small)
the object must be of height <span class='overunder'><span class='under'><em>a</em></span><br /><em>d</em></span> times the horizontal distance
which corresponds to one minute. For 25 centimeters' viewing-distance
this quantity is about 4, so that the least perceptible
elevation is <span class='overunder'>4<br /><span class='ov'>3400</span></span> or about <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>900</span></span>. The stereogram
having been made under conditions giving correct relief,
this fraction is also the fraction of the altitude of the plane
when the photograph was taken which may be detected.
An object as high as a man (6 feet) should be visible as a
projection in a stereoscopic view taken at 6 × 900 = 5400 feet.
This relation—<span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>900</span></span>—holds (irrespective of the focal length
of the lens), as long as the conditions for correct relief
are maintained.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Stereoscopic Aerial Cameras.</strong>—Cameras for aerial stereoscopic
photography need in no way differ in construction
from those made for mapping or spotting, provided only
they permit exposures to be made at short enough intervals.
The addition of special sights, as already discussed, constitutes
the only real difference between single view and stereoscopic
aerial cameras. But even without such sights ordinary
aerial cameras are applicable to stereo work by the usual
procedure of determining the exposure spacing by time.</p>

<p class='c000'>One scheme employed for taking low stereos, where the
interval is only two or three seconds, is to mount two cameras
in the plane, exposing them one after the other at the correct
interval. Another method which has been tried with success
is the use of a double focal-plane shutter in a single lens
camera (Fig. <a href='#fig_157'>157</a>). The two shutters are side by side, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>their slots parallel to the line of flight. To take a stereo
negative we expose first the shutter nearer the tail of the
plane, and then the other, after an interval which can be
calculated from the speed and altitude, or, better, determined
by a stereoscopic sight. The two views are thus obtained
on a single plate. Prints from these negatives are transposed
right and left, and, if the prints are viewed in an ordinary
stereoscope, have to be cut apart and transposed for mounting,
or else this may be done to the negatives.</p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>In this connection attention may be drawn to an alternative
method of viewing stereograms, which may be used on
transposed prints—a method which needs no instrument,
and so has sufficient advantage to even warrant mounting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>ordinary stereoscopic pairs in the transposed position for
observation. This method consists in crossing the optic
axes, in the fashion illustrated in Fig. <a href='#fig_158'>158</a>. A finger is held
in front of the face in such a position that the left stereogram
element and the finger are seen in line by the right eye; the
right element and the finger by the left eye. The proper
position is found by alternately closing each eye, and advancing
or retracting the finger. Then both eyes are opened and
converged on the finger tip, which is thereupon dropped,
leaving the picture standing out in relief. An opportunity
to try this method is afforded by Fig. <a href='#fig_159'>159</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Stereo Obliques.</strong>—The theory of making oblique stereo
pictures is identical with that of other stereos. The only
problem peculiar to obliques is that of making the exposures
at short enough intervals apart. This problem is due largely
to the fact that oblique views are ordinarily taken from low
altitudes, for the purpose of “spotting” particular objects,
rather than for mapping the gross features of an extended
area. The same problem of how to secure a short exposure
interval is met with when we attempt to take vertical stereos
from a low altitude, but as already discussed, it is much
preferable from the pictorial standpoint that pictures of
definite small objectives be made obliquely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another reason for taking stereo obliques from points but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>little separated is of some interest in connection with the
discussion above given of “correct” and “natural” relief.
When the relief is “correct” the object appears, as already
stated, to be a small model in its true proportions, standing
at the convergence distance. When the eyes are converged
to a small object 25 to 50 centimeters away all objects
beyond are hopelessly transposed and confused. This does
not happen when we look at large distant objects, since their
background is at a distance effectively but little beyond them.
As a result, when a stereo oblique is made in “correct” relief
of such an object as the Washington monument with buildings
beyond, the confusion of the background presents an
appearance entirely contrary to our visual experience with
objects as large as the neighboring buildings are known to
be. This effect may be avoided by choosing a uniform background
such as grass, or by taking the pictures very much
closer together, at the expense of “correct” but at a gain
in “natural” relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stereo obliques can of course only be made with any
facility by laterally pointing cameras. From the calculations
already given it appears that a “correct” stereo oblique of
an object 500 meters away will mean exposures only two or
three seconds apart, too short an interval for any of the
ordinary plate-changing and shutter-setting mechanisms;
and the case is even worse should less relief be desired. One
solution of this problem has been the use, already mentioned,
of two cameras mounted together, either side by side or one
over the other, with separate shutter releases. Both releases
may be controlled by the observer, using a sight, or else
pilot and observer may work in harmony as has been recommended
in the English service, where the pilot releases one
shutter and the observer counts time from the instant he
sees the first shutter unwind and releases the second.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A very satisfactory apparatus for the taking of stereo
obliques consists of a 10-inch focus hand-held camera (Fig.
<a href='#fig_157'>157</a>), provided with a two-aperture focal-plane shutter. The
right-hand half of one curtain aperture is blocked out, the
left-hand half of the other. The first pressure on the exposing
lever exposes one-half of the plate, the second the other. A
stereoscopic sight of the type already described is placed on
the bottom. To make an oblique stereo negative the camera
is held rigidly by resting the elbows on the top of the fuselage
and the first exposure is made when the object comes in
line with the rear sight and the leading front sight. The eye
is then moved so as to look along the line of the rear sight
and the following front sight, and when the object is again
in alinement the second pressure is given the exposing lever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Fig. <a href='#fig_159'>159</a> shows a stereo oblique made by this camera. The
elements are transposed right and left, and the stereogram
may be viewed by crossing the optic axes as shown in Fig.
<a href='#fig_158'>158</a>, or the two pictures may be cut apart and remounted.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>The Mounting of Aerial Stereograms.</strong>—The first step in
making the printed stereogram is to select two pictures taken
on the same scale, but from slightly different positions.
These may be two chosen from a collection made for other
purposes, or else a pair taken at distances calculated to fit
them for stereoscopic use. The next step is to mark the
center of each picture, either with easily removed chalk or
with a pin point. They are then superposed, and afterward
carefully moved apart by a motion parallel to the line joining
their centers when superposed. The final step before mounting
is to mark out and cut the two elements, their bases being
parallel to the line of centers, their horizontal length the distance
between the optic axes of the stereoscope (or as near
this as the size of the prints will permit). They are then
mounted on a card, with their centers separated by approximately
65 millimeters. The right-hand view is the one showing
more of the right-hand side of objects, and vice versa.
This process of arranging, cutting, and mounting is shown
clearly in Fig. <a href='#fig_160'>160</a>. In this case the stereoscopic elements
lie symmetrically about the line joining the centers of the
original prints. This is not necessary, as they may be selected
from above or below this line so long as their bases are parallel
to it. A simplification of this method consists in superposing
the two prints, laying over them a square of glass of
the size to which they are to be cut, then turning it so that a
side is parallel to the line of centers, and cutting around it
through both prints with a sharp knife. The principle and
results are of course the same with both methods.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>If large numbers of stereoscopic prints are required it is
necessary, for economy of time, either to photograph a finished
stereogram and make prints from this copy negative,
or to set up special printing machines. Under the general
discussion of printing devices a stereoscopic printer is
described (the Richard) in which the two negatives are
placed so that stereo prints can be got by two successive
printings on one sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Uses of Stereoscopic Aerial Views.</strong>—Attention has
already been called to the characteristic flatness of the aerial
view. Neither the picture on the retina nor that on the
photographic plate affords any adequate idea of hills and
hollows. Unless shadows are well defined, small local elevations
and depressions cannot be distinguished from mere
difference in color or marking. Even in the presence of
shadows it is often only by close study that differences of
contour are noticeable. But with stereoscopic views these
features stand out in a striking manner. Taking our illustrations
from military sources, we may note the use of stereoscopic
pictures to detect undulations of ground in front of
trenches (Fig. <a href='#fig_161'>161</a>). They reveal the hillocks, pits, small
quarries, streams flowing behind high banks, and other
features which make the attack hard or easy. Commanding
positions are shown, the boundaries of areas exposed to
machine-gun fire, and the defilades where the attackers may
pause to reform. Concrete “pill boxes” are located in the
midst of shell holes of the same size and outline, and can be
differentiated from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Railway or road embankments and cuts can be detected
and studied to extraordinary advantage in stereoscopic pictures.
Thus what appears to be a mine crater on a level
road, easily driven around, may be a gap blown in an
embankment, a serious obstacle indeed. Bridges, observation
towers and other elevated structures jump into view in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>the stereoscope when often they have entirely eluded notice
in the ordinary flat picture. Once presented in relief, camouflaged
buildings or gun emplacements, however carefully
painted, are ridiculously easy to pick out.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 161.</span>—Typical stereogram of military detail. Fuse by looking at a distant object over the top of the page, and quickly dropping the eyes to the print.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Practical peace-time applications of stereoscopic views
can easily be foreseen following the lines of war experience.
Such, for instance, would be the study of proposed railway or
canal routes. A series of stereograms would obviate the
necessity of contour surveys, at least until the exact route
was picked and construction work ready to start.</p>

<p class='c000'>Apart from their utilitarian side, however, stereoscopic
views have very great pictorial merit. Stereoscopic pictures
of cathedrals, public and other large buildings, have often
great beauty, and afford opportunities for the study of form
given by no other kind of representation, short of expensive
scale models. They may very well lead in the near future to a
revival of the popularity of the stereoscope.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Impression of Relief Produced by Motion.</strong>—An appearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>of solidity can be obtained in <em>moving pictures</em> by the
simple expedient of slowly moving the camera laterally as
the pictures are taken. As an illustration, if the moving
picture camera is carried on a boat while structures on the
shore are photographed, when these are projected on the
screen they appear in relief, due to the relative motion of
foreground and background. As relief of this sort is not
dependent on the use of the two eyes, it demands no special
viewing apparatus. This idea has been utilized to a limited
extent in ordinary moving picture photography by introducing
a slow to-and-fro motion of the camera, but this can
hardly be considered satisfactory, since this motion is so
obviously unnatural.</p>

<p class='c000'>In moving pictures made from the airplane the normal
rapid motion of the point of view is ideal for the production
of the impression of relief in the manner just described. For
instance, in moving pictures of a city made from a low flying
plane, the skyscrapers and spires as they sweep past stand
forth from their more slowly moving background in bold and
satisfying solidity. In fact, such pictures probably constitute
the most satisfactory solution yet found of the vexing problem
of “stereoscopic” projection. No better medium can be
imagined for the travel lecturer to introduce his audience to a
foreign city than to throw upon his screen a film made in a
plane approaching from afar and then circling the architectural
landmarks at low altitudes.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <span class='large'>THE INTERPRETATION OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Oblique aerial photographs if on a large enough scale are
even easier to interpret than are ordinary photographs taken
from the ground, since they practically preserve the usual
view, and add to it the essentials of a plan. With verticals,
however, this is far from the case. In them all natural objects
present an appearance quite foreign to the ordinary mortal's
previous experience of them. This may be easily demonstrated
by taking any aerial view containing a fair amount
of detail and trying systematically to identify each object.
A necessary preliminary to doing this accurately is acquaintance
with and study of the ground photographed, or of
similar regions, and of objects of the same character as
those likely to be included.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interpretation of military aerial photographs is of
such importance, and has become such an art, that it is the
function of special departments of the intelligence service.
Extended courses in the subject are now given in military
schools. This instruction must cover more than the interpretation
of aerial photographs as such. General military
knowledge is essential, so that not only may photographed
objects be recognized, but the significance of their appearance
be realized. Whether attack or retreat is indicated;
whether a long range bombardment is in preparation, or a
mere strengthening of local defences.</p>

<p class='c000'>The natural difficulties of interpreting aerial views are
enormously increased by the unfamiliar nature and frequently
changed character of the military structures, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>particularly by the attempts made to conceal these from
aerial observation by selection of surroundings and by camouflage.
The small scale of the photographs, in which a
machine gun shows as a mere pin point, adds to the uncertainty,
with the net result of making interpretation a task
of minute study and deduction worthy of a Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Little detailed information on interpretation can be
profitably written in a general treatise, partly because the
illustrations available are of a highly technical military character,
partly because original photographs instead of halftone
reproductions are practically imperative for purposes
of study. Nevertheless some general instructions, applicable
to any problem of interpretation, may be given, as well as a
few illustrations, drawn from military sources, which will
serve to show the detective skill necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>First of all it is important that the print or transparency
be held in the right position. The shadows must always fall
toward the observer; otherwise, reliefs will appear as hollows
and hollows will show as hills. The reason for this is that the
body ordinarily acts as a shield, preventing the formation of
shadows except by light falling toward the beholder. Thus
in Fig. <a href='#fig_162'>162</a> the slag heap looks like a quarry when the
shadows fall away from one. The necessity for proper direction
of shadows is, it may be noted, in conflict with the
ordinary convention for the orientation of maps—at least in
the northern hemisphere. A city map, made by sunlight
falling from the south, presents its shadows as falling away
from the observer, when it is mounted with its north point
at the top, as is customary. As a consequence buildings in
aerial photographic mosaics of cities occasionally look
sunken instead of standing out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The relation between the shape of the shadow and the
object casting it must be well learned. This is a part of the
training of every architectural draftsman, but the appearance
of shadows from above has not heretofore been a matter
of importance. The difference between high and low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>trenches, between cuttings and embankments, between shell
holes, occupied or unoccupied, and “pill boxes,” must be
detected largely from the character of the shadows. Which
elevations and depressions are of military and which of
merely accessory nature, whether this black dot is a machine
gun or a signaling device, whether that dark spot is an active
gun port or an abandoned one—these are all matters of
shadow and of light and shade study. Several illustrations
of these points appear in Figs. <a href='#fig_163'>163</a>, <a href='#fig_164'>164</a> and <a href='#fig_165'>165</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shadows may be used to get exact information as to
directions and magnitudes. If we know the time of day at
which a picture is taken, the direction of the shadows will
give the points of the compass. A chart for doing this is
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_166'>166</a>. The length of a shadow is a measure of
the height of the object casting it, and the exact relation
between the two dimensions is determined by the day and
hour. Fig. <a href='#fig_167'>167</a> embodies in chart form the values of this
relationship for all times of the year and day, while Fig. <a href='#fig_168'>168</a>
shows the kind of picture in which shadow data could be
utilized to great profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Minute changes, both in light and shade and in position,
must be watched for with great care. Naturally growing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>foliage and the cut branches used for camouflage differ in
color progressively with the drying up of the leaves. Hence
a mere spot of lighter tone in a picture of a forest, especially
if the picture is taken through a deep filter, becomes instant
object for suspicion. The complete study of any position
calls for photographs of all kinds—verticals, obliques, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>stereos. Stereoscopic views are the worst foe to camouflage.

<p class='c000'>A few illustrations of the more ordinary and obvious
objects whose detection is the subject of aerial photography
are shown in accompanying figures. Fig. <a href='#fig_169'>169</a> pictures a
typical trench system, with barbed wire. The trenches show
as narrow castellated lines, from which run the zigzag lines
of communicating trenches, saps, and listening posts. The
minute pockmarks behind the main trench lines are shell
holes and machine gun pits. The barbed wire shows as
double and triple gray bands, intricately criss-crossed at
strategic points. Another form of defence, intended for the
same purpose as the barbed wire of the western front, is that
furnished by overthrown trees in forest regions. Fig. <a href='#fig_170'>170</a>
reveals a mountain fortress surrounded by a zone of felled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>trees, and indicates in striking manner the value of the information

force. Fig. <a href='#fig_123'>123</a> shows on a comparatively large scale
opposing trench systems in which a natural obstacle—a
river—separates the adversaries. Nicks and dots indicate
machine guns to the skilled eye, and several rectangular
structures are revealed as concrete buildings which have
survived unscathed the shell fire which has obliterated, and
caused to be rebuilt, nearly every other element of the
trench system.</p>

these show as fine light lines, obliterated by growing vegetation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>if long disused. Another indication is the blast marks
in front of the gun muzzles; occasionally the sensitive plate
will catch the actual puff of smoke as the gun is discharged.</p>

<p class='c000'>Railways of various gauges show as thin lines, crossed
by ties, and exhibiting the characteristic curves and switches.
They are particularly important to detect because they
naturally lead to guns or supplies of importance. Abandoned
railways from which the rails and ties have been removed
leave their marks on the ground and must be carefully
distinguished from lines in actual operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aviation fields are easily recognized by the hangars,
often with “funk hole” trenches alongside for the men to
take shelter in during air raids (Fig. <a href='#fig_172'>172</a>). Other characteristic
features are the “T” which shows the direction of the
wind to the returning pilot, and of course the planes themselves,
standing on the ground. But the field may be inactive,
and the planes merely canvas dummies, so that to
pierce the disguise, all paths, ruts, and other indications of
activity must be minutely studied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Overhead telegraph and telephone lines are revealed
when new by a series of light points (Fig. <a href='#fig_174'>174</a>), where the
posts have been erected in the fresh turned earth. Later,
when the fields through which they pass are cultivated, the
post bases show as islands left unturned by the plow. In
winter the wires reveal their position by black lines in the
snow caused by drippings. Buried cables are indicated
while building by their trenches, and for some time afterward
by the comparatively straight line of disturbed earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Just as the detective of classic story makes full use of
freshly fallen snow to identify the footprints of the criminal,
so does the aerial photographer utilize a snowfall to pierce
the enemy's attempts at deception. Tracks in the snow
show which trenches or batteries are in actual use. Melting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>of the snow in certain places may mean fires in dugouts
beneath. Black smudges in front of trench walls show where
guns are active. Guns, wire and other objects, however

results of the interpretation must be made available to the
artilleryman or the attacking infantryman. This may be
done by legends marked directly on the photograph. Another
method is to mount over the photograph a thin tissue paper
or oilskin leaf, with the interpretation marked on it. A yet
more elegant method consists in outlining all the chief features
of the photograph in ink, writing in the points of
importance in interpretation, and then bleaching out the
photograph with potassium permanganate solution. Photographic
copies of the resultant line drawing are then mounted
side by side with the original photograph. Fig. <a href='#fig_174'>174</a>, which
shows a fully interpreted photograph, is an example of this
kind of mounting.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The problems of naval aerial photography are quite
different from those of military aerial work, and on the whole
they are more simple. At the same time, photography has
played a considerably less important part in naval aerial
warfare than in land operations. Photography as a necessary
preparation for attack has not figured in naval practice
nearly so much as have the record and instruction aspects.
To some extent this is due to the nature of the naval operations
in the Great War, to some extent to the limitations of
ceiling and cruising radius of the naval aircraft.</p>

<p class='c000'>A photographic reconnaissance, preceding and following
a bombardment of shore batteries; a photographic record of
the ships at anchor, as at Santiago; a photograph of the forts
defending a channel, as at Manila; photographs, quickly
developed and printed, of an approaching fleet—all these
are possibilities of great usefulness in naval warfare between
contestants both of whom “come out” and carry the struggle
to the enemy's gates. But in the recent war the use of the
submarine, operations under cover of fog, the striving for
“low visibility,” and the considerable distances to be
traversed to reach the enemy lairs, have conspired to limit
the development of photography as a major aid to naval
combat. Probably when the whole history of the conflict
is told we shall learn that the Zeppelins which cruised over
the North Sea, keeping the Allied fleet under observation,
had a regular routine of photographic work. In the Italian
zone, where much of the enemy territory and several important
naval centers lay at only short distances over the Adriatic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>the naval photographic service more nearly rivalled
that of the army than in the English, French and American
zone of activity in the Channel and North Sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The majority of the photographs made in the British
service were obliques, taken by short focus (6 to 10 inch)
hand-held cameras. This type was employed partly because
of difficulties to be noted presently, in using other forms of
cameras, but more especially because such pictures sufficed
for the kind of information desired. A hand-held camera
formed part of the outfit of each flying boat and dirigible,
but, unlike land reconnaissance, planes ascending
primarily for picture taking were unknown in their naval
service. Usually no photographic objective was predetermined—photographs
were made only if objects of interest
were come upon. Mapping also formed no part of the seaplane's
work. Four plates would be carried, instead of as
many dozens in the land machine, and often these would
come back unexposed. There were of course some photographic
flights planned out beforehand, for the purpose of
photographing lighthouses and other landmarks whose
appearance from the air should be known to the naval aviator
(Fig. <a href='#fig_175'>175</a>). Among the accidental and record types of
photograph come convoys (Fig. <a href='#fig_176'>176</a>), whose composition and
arrangement were made a matter of record, particularly if
any ship was out of its assigned position. Photographs of
oil spots on the sea surface, or other results of bomb dropping,
were necessary evidence to establish the sinking of a submarine
(Fig. <a href='#fig_179'>179</a>). Pictures of all types of ships friendly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>neutral, and where possible, enemy—were a much needed
part of naval equipment, in particular pictures of friendly
destroyers and submarines, which should not be bombed
by mistake. For safe navigation it was essential to have
photographs of uncharted wrecks (Fig. <a href='#fig_181'>181</a>), of buoys out
of place and of ships failing to return signals or otherwise
to comply with rules. The great majority of the pictures
were taken from altitudes of not more than 300 meters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hand-held cameras for naval work have practically the
same design as those for land work. In view of the smaller
number of pictures taken on naval trips, and the consequent
absence of any need for great speed in changing plates, the
ordinary two-plate dark slide has been found satisfactory in
the English service. But these are much less convenient
than the bag magazines used in the U. S. Naval hand camera
(Fig. <a href='#fig_031'>31</a>). The sights on the naval hand camera are preferably
of the rectangular, field indicating type, especially useful
in photographing extended objects such as convoys. As the
flying boat travels comparatively slow, it is easy for the
observer to stand up to take pictures, and the sight is conveniently
placed on top. But if held out over the side for
verticals the sight must be on the bottom. Rectangular
sights in both positions are provided in the English camera
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>(Fig. <a href='#fig_186'>186</a>). Naval cameras should be immune from moisture,
which means doing away with all wooden slides or grooves.
A praiseworthy practice is to carry the camera in a waterproof
bag.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Cameras other than of the hand-held form have been
little used in sea planes, owing to the difficulties of installation.
The hydro-airplane, consisting of an ordinary airplane
fuselage mounted on two pontoons (Fig. <a href='#fig_182'>182</a>), can carry the
same kind of photographic equipment as the land machine.
But if it has a single central pontoon this is not feasible.
The hydro-airplane is, however, largely superseded by the
flying boat (Fig. <a href='#fig_183'>183</a>), whose fuselage, of boat form, rests
directly on the water. In this type of sea plane, views taken
vertically downward are not easy to make. In the larger
flying boats the hull projects out horizontally a matter of
several feet beyond the side of the cockpit. An ordinary
outboard mounting is therefore out of the question. The
camera must either be held out at arm's length or else
mounted on a long bracket (Fig. <a href='#fig_186'>186</a>). The usual place for
carrying the camera is in the front cockpit with its magnificent
all-round view. Obliques can, too, be taken in great
comfort from the side windows behind the wings, as shown
in Fig. <a href='#fig_185'>185</a>. The possibility of cutting a hole in the bottom
of a flying boat to take care of a vertical camera is not
entertained in British and American naval circles. Nevertheless
it is the regular practice in the Italian service, with
their small high ceilinged flying boats. In them a round hole
is cut in the floor, stopped with a plug and rubber gasket.
After the boat rises into the air the hole is opened, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>regulation Italian camera is set securely in a frame on the
floor over the hole (Fig. <a href='#fig_187'>187</a>). Photographs are taken to
the capacity of the camera, and if it is desired another camera
is put in its place, till all its plates have been exposed, and
then even a third. Before coming down the hole must
of course be closed again. Sliding doors have been designed
to close this aperture, but have not proved sufficiently
water-tight, although such a device could undoubtedly be
worked out.</p>

<div class='ic003'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 187.</span>—Italian flying boat with camera mounted on the floor.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>With its space for five or more passengers, and with its
low speed, the modern flying boat affords an excellent craft
for photographic work. There is ample room for any size
of camera, and for any style of mounting, if we assume that
there is no objection to an opening in the bottom. The low
ceiling of these ships, however, prevents their use for certain
forms of aerial photography which should be of the greatest
importance. Operations against shore stations—harbors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>docks, shipyards, ships at anchor, and fortifications—cannot
be undertaken for fear of anti-aircraft guns and hostile land
planes. The solution of the problem of carrying and launching
fast high flying planes from ships will immediately extend
the usefulness of aerial photography to coastal work. In
the recent war, such of this as was done, along the Belgian
coast—the shore batteries, and the results of naval operations
at Zeebrugge and Ostend—was done by land planes from
territory held by the Allies. The photographic equipment of
sea planes of the type suggested will of course present special
problems, but the apparatus used will be apt to approximate
closely to that of the land planes.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <span class='large'>FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS IN APPARATUS AND METHODS</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Prophecy is an undertaking that always involves risk.
The prophet's guess of what the future will bring forth is
based only on the tendencies of the past, the most urgent
needs of the present, and the activity of his imagination.
He may easily—and he usually does—entirely overlook
certain possibilities which may arise apparently from nowhere
and which profoundly affect the whole trend of development.
Conditions which dominate at the present time—such
as military necessity—may happily drop into the background
and free the science from some of its severest restrictions.
With this caution, some future possibilities in apparatus
and methods may be presented along the lines already
used in discussing the present status of aerial photography.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Lenses.</strong>—From the military standpoint the next steps
in lens design would be toward telephoto lenses on the one
hand, and on the other toward lenses of short focus and wide
angle. The telephoto lenses used for spotting would be of
long equivalent focus—a meter and more—but of handy
size, that is, not more than 50 centimeters over all working
distance. The wide angle short focus lenses would be
designed for low flying reconnaissance or quick mapping
work. They would also be demanded for peace-time mapping
projects, where the largest possible amount of territory
should be covered in a single flight. Both types of lens
should be pushed to the extreme in aperture, for short exposures
and the maximum of working days will always
be demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span><strong>Cameras.</strong>—Peace-times will give the necessary opportunity
to develop self-contained and therefore simply
installed cameras. They will at the same time be made
very completely automatic but simple to operate in spite of
their complexity. Such cameras have, during the war, been
the ideal of all aerial photographers, but the time has
been too short since the necessary conditions have been
understood for that lengthy development work and those
complete service tests which are so necessary to develop
all automatic apparatus. Several designs which are now
being perfected may be counted on to take us a long way
toward this ideal.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other hand, that military ideal which leaves the
camera operator the greatest possible freedom for other
activities, is apt to be entirely reversed in peace. The
camera operator can now be required to be an expert, who
will be free to change plates or filters and to estimate exposures,
instead of giving his best efforts to the problem of
defence. For him a simple and reliable hand-operated or
semi-automatic camera is entirely satisfactory, and the great
expense of complicated automatic apparatus has no longer
its former justification.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Camera Suspension.</strong>—Perhaps the most pleasing prospect
before the aerial photographer as he turns from war to
peace work is that of having planes built for and dedicated
primarily to photography. Instead of his camera being
relegated to an inaccessible position, picked after the plane
design has been officially “locked;” instead of yielding first
place to controls, machine gun and ammunition; instead of
being jealously criticised for the space and weight it takes
up, the camera can now claim space, weight, and location
suitable for any likely aerial photographic need. High speed
no longer will be vital, and slower planes, permitting longer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>exposures in inverse ratio to their speed, will be chosen for
photographic purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>A development which is sure to intrigue many investigators
is the gyroscopically controlled camera. This has its
chief <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d'être</span></i> in precision mapping, whose possibilities
from the air will undoubtedly be intensively studied at once.
With the automatically leveled camera will come renewed
attention to indicators of time, altitude, and direction, with
the ultimate goal of producing aerial negatives that show
upon their face the exact printing and arranging directions
necessary to put together an accurate map.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Sensitive Materials.</strong>—Manufacturers of plates and films
will direct efforts toward producing emulsions of good contrast,
high color sensitiveness and high effective speed,
especially when used in conjunction with the filters necessary
for haze penetration. Exposure data will be accumulated
and exposure meters appropriate for aerial work will
be developed.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Color Photography.</strong>—Color photography from the air by
any of the screen-plate or film-pack methods is probably
out of the question because of the long exposures required.
The screen-plates are unsuitable also because of the relatively
large size of their grain compared to the detail of the aerial
photograph. Ordinary three-color photography, using three
separate negatives, is always subject on the earth's surface
to the difficulty that the three negatives must be exposed
from the same point of view, either in succession or by means
of some optical arrangement which is costly from the standpoint
of light. In photographing from the air this difficulty
of securing a single point of view for the three photographs
is absent. Three matched cameras, side by side in the fuselage,
have identical points of view as far as objects on the
earth below are in question. Consequently, three-color
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>negatives are entirely possible, and indeed will be simple
to make as soon as plates of adequate color sensitiveness and
speed are available. Probably the new Ilford panchromatic
plate has the necessary qualities.</p>

<p class='c000'><strong>Night Photography.</strong>—The searching eye of photography
was so omnipresent in the later stages of the Great War
that extensive troop movements and other preparations had
to be carried out either in photographically impossible
weather or else at night. The natural reply to the utilization
of the cover of night is to “turn night into day” by proper
artificial illumination. At first thought it might well appear
that the task of illuminating a whole landscape adequately
for airplane photography is well-nigh hopeless by any artificial
means. On one hand we have the very short exposures alone
permissible; on the other the fact that the intensity of daylight
illumination is overwhelmingly greater than those common
in the most extravagant forms of artificial illumination.</p>

<p class='c000'>Toward the close of the war, however, actual experiments
made with instantaneous flashes of several million candlepower
showed that if proper means were provided to insure
the flash going off near the ground, and if its duration were
made no longer than about <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>50</span></span> second, interpretable photographs
were obtainable on the fastest plates. It appears,
therefore, merely a matter of manufacturers perfecting the
technique of flash production, and of inventors providing
the launching and igniting devices to push this kind of
photography to the practical stage. The achievement of
night photography cannot fail to have an enormous effect
on future tactics.</p>

<p class='c000'>The technique of night photography may take either of
two directions. On one hand we may develop flashes of the
requisite intensity to give all their light in <span class='overunder'>1<br /><span class='ov'>100</span></span> second; on
the other hand, it may prove more feasible to use flashes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>longer duration and to arrange for the camera shutter (of the
between-the-lens type) to be exposed synchronously with
the middle of the flash. One way, frequently suggested, to
use these longer flashes would be to trail the charge on a long
wire, through which the ignition is effected electrically. This
is not likely to be satisfactory, however, for the resistance of a
wire is so great that when the plane flies at any practical
height, the trailed flash, if it reaches near the ground, will
be forced to a very great distance behind. Probably the
best solution will involve accurate synchronizing of the fuse
in the freely dropped sack of flash powder with the exposing
mechanism in the camera.</p>

<p class='c006'>Aside from their element of novelty, aerial photographs
have undoubted qualities of beauty and utility. The “bird's-eye
view” has always been a favorite for revealing to the
best advantage the entire form and location of buildings and
of other large objects. Heretofore such views have usually
had to be drawn by an imaginative artist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aerial oblique views possess the virtues both of pictures
and of plans. They are destined to be extensively used in
the study of architecture (Fig. <a href='#fig_188'>188</a>). Cathedrals, castles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>town halls, particularly those still in their cramped medieval
surroundings where they can never be seen in their entirety
from the ground, come forth in all their beautiful or quaint
proportions from the airman's point of vantage. Stereoscopic
aerial views are destined to occupy a valuable position also.
Stereo prints of the famous buildings of Europe, taken from
the air, will give to the prospective traveler or the arm-chair
tourist a many fold more accurate idea of their construction
than will any number of mere surface views.</p>

<p class='c000'>A vertical aerial photograph is most closely akin to a
map, but has advantages over any ordinary surveyor's
product. As a guide it is infinitely superior to the best
draftsman's diagram, for it provides a wealth of detail
whereby the traveller may definitely locate himself. At a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>single glance he notes the objects of interest within his radius
of easy travel. The guide-book of the future will therefore
be incomplete without numerous aerial views, both vertical
and oblique. As an illustration of the peculiar merit of the
view from the air, consider the photograph of Vienna made
during d'Annunzio's “propaganda” bombardment. Or the
picture of the Rialto bridge (Fig. <a href='#fig_190'>190</a>). No ordinary photograph
from land or water suggests the central roadway and
no map shows the beauty of its elevation. Both are shown
here, as well as an intimate view of the arched and pillared
courtyard of the Fondaco de' Tedeschi to the right.</p>

<p class='c000'>Airplane photographs will undoubtedly be widely used
in certain fields of advertising. Architects and real estate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>agents may be expected to display their wares by the aid
of aerial views. A well-planned country estate or golf course,
or a suburban development (Fig. <a href='#fig_191'>191</a>), can be shown with a
completeness, both as to environment and stage of progress
which no other form of representation can approach. A sea-side
resort can now show the extent and grouping of its
natural and artificial amusement features in a single picture
(Fig. <a href='#fig_192'>192</a>). Even the extent of its bathing beach under water
is revealed to the aerial photographer (Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>). Real
estate agents can utilize aerial photographic maps of cities
to great advantage. On these their properties can be pointed
out, with the nature of their surroundings shown at a glance,
together with their relation to transportation, schools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>churches, shopping districts, parks, or factories. The future
purchaser of lots in a distant boom town will no longer be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>satisfied with a map outlining the streets with high-sounding
names. He will demand an authentic aerial photograph,
showing the actual number of houses under construction, the
streets, gutters and sidewalks already laid, the size and
planting of trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>The study of landscape gardening is another field for
which the aerial photograph is peculiarly fitted. A collection
of oblique pictures of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">châteaux</span> and palaces of Europe
showing their approaches and grounds, or of the historic estates
of our own South, (Fig. <a href='#fig_194'>194</a>), will be worth more to the
prospective designer of a country estate than maps and
ground pictures can ever be. Closely allied to landscape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>gardening is city planning, for which the aerial map will be
quite indispensable. The appearance of a city from the air
may indeed become a matter of pride to its inhabitants, and
not only the arrangement of streets and parks, but even the
character of the roofs of the buildings, be the subject of
study (Fig. <a href='#fig_195'>195</a>).</p>

<p class='c000'>Engineers and constructors will depend more and more
on preliminary photographic surveys as a basis for locating
their operations. At the later stages of their work they will
use aerial photographs for recording progress. Periodic
photographs of buildings in process of construction, such as
are now made from the ground, are much more illustrative
when made from the air. Only from above is it possible to
obtain in a single picture the progress of the complete project,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>such as the construction of an aviation field (Figs. <a href='#fig_196'>196</a> and
<a href='#fig_197'>197</a>) or of a shipyard. The building of large structures—bridges,
hotels, ships on the stocks—particularly demands
aerial views if the foreground is not to eclipse the center of
real interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>News events will soon call for an aerial photographic
service. Already we are seeing newspapers and magazines
featuring aerial photographs of the entry into conquered
cities and the parades of returning fleets. Accidents, fires,
floods and wrecks, of either local or national interest, can
best be represented by this newest form of photography.</p>

<p class='c000'>The photographing of wrecks, fires and floods suggests
the importance of aerial views to insurance underwriters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>who require the most minute information on the characteristics
of buildings in every neighborhood, and on the extent
and nature of damage done. Marine insurance companies
might with profit use the airplane camera to help estimate
the chances of salvage of a stranded ship or a vessel
foundered in shallow waters (Fig. <a href='#fig_181'>181</a>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Numerous scientific uses for aerial views seem likely.
Prominent among these is their use in geology, for the study
of the various forms of earth sculpture. Pictures from the
air of extinct volcanoes will give information as to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>configuration that would otherwise require months of painstaking
survey to obtain. Aerial photographs of active volcanoes
(Fig. <a href='#fig_198'>198</a>), showing the results of a succession of outbursts—one
obliterating the other—would prove of the greatest
value, especially when studied in conjunction with other
scientific data, the whole making a record unobtainable by
any other means.</p>

<p class='c000'>In earthquake regions—notably Southern Italy and
Japan—the changing coast lines, shallows and safe harbors,
could be promptly ascertained after the subsidence of each
fresh shock, with a consequent keeping open of trade routes
and often the saving of life. River courses, glacier formations,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cañons</span>, and all the larger natural formations which
man usually sees only in minute sections, and which he
must build up in his mind's eye or by models, are today
quickly and accurately recorded by the camera in the air.
Such formations as coral reefs, whose configurations can
now be accurately learned only by laborious surveys of a
limited number, could be studied in quantity and with heretofore
unknown satisfaction as the result of a single expedition
with a ship-carrying seaplane and aerial camera.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another scientific field—probably one of many similar
ones—lies in the study of the waves set up by ships (Fig. <a href='#fig_199'>199</a>).
These are of extreme importance in the realm of naval
architecture, but before the day of the airplane could never
be easily studied in full scale.</p>

  <h3 class='c002'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /> <span class='large'>EXPLORATION AND MAPPING</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Aerial photographic mapping in war-time has been
almost entirely confined to inserting new details in old
maps. For such work some distortion or a lack of complete
information on altitude and directions is not a serious matter,
because the known permanent outlines serve as a
basis. Furthermore, in so far as outline maps are concerned,
as distinguished from pictorial maps, these have been drawn
on the ordinary scales, and with the ordinary conventions of
engineering map practice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aerial photography may be used in the future in practically
the same way, as an aid to the quick recording of
those minute details which would ordinarily consume an
enormous amount of labor to survey directly. The region
shown in Fig. <a href='#fig_200'>200</a> affords a good illustration. A discouraging
amount of time and effort would be required to map this
section of Virginia by the usual methods, while the smallest
curve of creek and shore is instantly and completely recorded
on a single photographic plate. But there are other possibilities,
diverging from this application both toward greater
and lesser requirements for precision.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pictorial maps, in which the actual photographs figure,
promise to be an essential part of the airman's equipment,
whether he be pilot or passenger, mail carrier or sportsman.
Without any pretention to detailed accuracy of
location, these maps will show, in strip or mosaic form, the
general appearance of the country to be traversed, with
particular reference to good landing fields and other points
of interest to the aviator. Vertical pictorial maps may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>supplemented by obliques giving the view ahead, whereby
the pilot may direct his ship. Thus the Washington monument
as seen by the pilot from Baltimore is a truer guide
than is the country beneath him. The crossing of mountain
ranges is another case where the oblique picture will be more
useful than the vertical (Fig. <a href='#fig_201'>201</a>).</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 201.</span>—Seeking out mountain passes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Contrasted with the merely pictorial maps will be precision
surveys. Whether it will prove practical to make
these entirely from the air is still an open question. It is
to be assumed that cameras can be constructed with lenses
having negligible distortion of field, with between-the-lens
shutters to obviate the distortions due to the focal-plane
type, with auxiliary devices for indicating compass direction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>altitude, and inclination, or with gyroscopic mounting so
that an inclination indicator is unnecessary. The application
of aerial photography to precision mapping will depend
upon the perfection which such cameras attain, as estimated
by the permissible errors in this form of mapping. Entire
dependence on photography, as in uncharted regions, is
likely to be worked up to slowly, beginning with a stage
of rather complete triangulation of natural or artificial
points—say three in each constituent picture—then through
several stages each successively employing fewer and fewer
well determined points. The photographic mapping of
some of our Western States will be greatly facilitated
by the 100-yard squares into which the land is divided
and already marked in a manner which shows clearly in
aerial photographs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A theoretical possibility is the plotting of contours from
stereo-aerial pictures. Given two elements of a stereoscopic
pair, taken from points whose separation is known,
the position of any point in space shown in the stereoscopic
view can be determined by the use of the stereo-comparator.
This is an instrument already employed in mountain photo-surveying,
which consists essentially of a compound stereoscope
in whose eye-pieces are two points movable at will
so that the relief image formed by their fusion can be made
to coincide with any chosen part of the landscape.
The chief difficulty in the application of this idea to aerial
work is to fix the base line. This problem may be met in
some cases by using stereo obliques, and getting the base
line by simultaneously made vertical photographs of well
surveyed territory beneath. Possibly also methods can be
developed by which photographs from two or more known
altitudes may furnish the requisite data.</p>

<p class='c000'>City mapping is a field for which aerial photography is
peculiarly fitted (Fig. <a href='#fig_202'>202</a>). A complete map of a large
city is a labor of years. In fact, a modern city is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>dangerously near to growing faster than its maps. An
aerial map, on the contrary, can be produced in a few hours.
Paris was mapped with 800 plates in less than a day's actual
flying. Washington was completely mapped in 2½ hours,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>with less than 200 exposures. The entire map is shown, on a
greatly reduced scale, in Fig. <a href='#fig_203'>203</a>, while Fig. <a href='#fig_204'>204</a> shows a
small portion of it in full size, from which can be obtained an
idea of the dimensions of the original. These maps, while
not accurate enough for the recording of deeds and mortgages,
yet serve the majority of needs. There is indeed no
reason why with long focus cameras, given several accurately
marked points, the photographic map of a piece of real
estate should not be made with all the accuracy needed, still
leaving the whole process of partial surveying helped out by
photography an enormously simpler one than the usual method.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rougher types of surveying, in open country, offer a
most promising opportunity. Railway surveys, showing
the character of the country: passes through mountain
ranges: the available timber and other materials of construction.
Canal routes, with the available sources of water supply,
and the best choice of course to avoid deep cuttings and
aqueducts. Irrigation projects, with the natural lakes,
river courses and valleys, which may be dammed to form
storage basins. Coast, river and harbor surveys are possible
by aerial means with a promptness and frequency which
should entirely revolutionize the making of maps of waterways.
Shifts in channels and shallows, even of considerable
depth, stand out prominently in the aerial photograph.
The actual bottom, if not more than three or four meters
down—as in a bathing beach—shows in the aerial photograph
(Fig. <a href='#fig_193'>193</a>), while the varying surface tints caused by
light reflected from the bottom at far greater depths are
readily differentiated by the camera from the air. An
instantaneous photograph will thus perform the work now
done by a week's soundings. Fig. <a href='#fig_205'>205</a>, taken near Langley
Field, shows how the aerial photograph may be used to chart
natural channels, while Fig. <a href='#fig_206'>206</a> shows the dredged channels
of the port of Venice. Navigation of such a river as the
Mississippi with its shifting bars may come to be guided by
monthly or even weekly aerial photo maps.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>Among other uses for aerial photography will be the location
of timber. As one illustration, may be taken the discovery
of mahogany trees. Their foliage at certain times of
the year is of characteristic color. This may be recorded
on color sensitive plates with a scientifically chosen filter,
and the cutting expedition sent out with the photograph as
a guide. In this as in other cases where rough or unexplored
country is to be covered, it is a question whether the airplane
will after all be the most feasible craft, on account of
its necessarily rapid rate of travel, and its need for known
landing fields. The dirigible of large cruising radius, which
can seek its landing field at leisure, is probably indicated for
this kind of work. It may indeed, as already hinted, prove
to be the chief photographic aircraft of the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>Archæological surveys offer a fascinating opportunity
for airplane or dirigible balloon photography to render
scientific service. Buried in desert sands or overgrown with
tropical vegetation the ancient cities of Asia Minor, of
Burma, and of Yucatan evade discovery, and even when
found remain unmapped for decades. Discovery and mapping
can now go hand-in-hand. The topography of barbaric
or colonial towns and villages, whose importance could
not warrant elaborate surveys, but which should nevertheless
be a matter of record, will be quickly and easily plotted
by photography (Fig. <a href='#fig_207'>207</a>). To this day who knows how
the streets run in Timbuctu, and how, save from the air, can
we ever map the teeming cities of China? He who would follow
in the footsteps of Haroun-al-Raschid can even now explore
the by-ways of Bagdad by the aid of the Royal Air
Force photographic map!</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
